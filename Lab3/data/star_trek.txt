B'ETOR:
Full disruptors.

LURSA:
Target their Bridge.

B'ETOR:
I don't know. He bathed, now he is roaming the ship. He must be the only Engineer in Starfleet who does not go to Engineering!

LURSA:
Where is he now?

B'ETOR:
Then when is he going to Engineering?

LURSA:
He is.

B'ETOR:
I thought he was the Chief Engineer.

B'ETOR:
Where is he?

LURSA:
It's working.

LURSA:
We'll consider it a prisoner exchange.

B'ETOR:
The Captain would make a much more valuable hostage.

LURSA:
HoS qorDu.

B'ETOR:
Toh-pak-cha

KIRK:
Yes, well, congratulations, Ensign. It wouldn't be the Enterprise without a Sulu at the helm.

CHEKOV:
Twelve years, sir.

KIRK:
But that wasn't so long ago. It couldn't have been more than...

KIRK:
I don't want to hear anymore about it. I'm not going, and that's final.

CHEKOV:
Captain

CHEKOV:
Captain. Perhaps you have forgotten that tomorrow is the christening ceremony.

KIRK:
Tomorrow I want to make a tri-elliptical jump. That's where you jump out over Northern China and make three complete orbits before you start re-entry.

KIRK:
Thanks for pointing that out.

CHEKOV:
Actually, Captain, your precise target area was thirty-five meters that way.

PICARD:
I have to find a way to get to Soran.

DATA:
Approximately forty-seven minutes, sir.

DATA:
Sorry, sir. There is too much interference in the planet's ionosphere for an accurate reading.

PICARD:
Commander.

DATA:
"Lifeforms tiny little lifeforms. Where are the lifeforms-"

DATA:
Approximately two hundred thirty million.

PICARD:
Population?

DATA:
Veridian III is uninhabited, but Veridian IV supports a pre-industrial humanoid society.

PICARD:
Are any of them inhabited?

PICARD:
And destroy every planet in the system.

DATA:
It should be noted, sir, that the collapse of the Veridian star would produce a shock wave similar to the one we observed at Amargosa.

PICARD:
That's where he's going.

DATA:
Yes, sir. There are two in the Veridian system.

PICARD:
He can't go to the ribbon, so he's trying to make the ribbon come to him. Data, is it going to pass near any M-Class planets?

DATA:
I believe so.

PICARD:
Now, you said the gravitational forces in this sector have been altered, could that also affect the course of the ribbon?

DATA:
I believe so.

PICARD:
Courage is an emotion too, Data. Now, can you project the course of the ribbon?

PICARD:
Can you project its course?

DATA:
This is its current position.

DATA:
The destruction of the Amargosa star has altered the gravitational forces throughout the sector. Any ship passing through this region will have to make a minor course correction.

PICARD:
Wait. The Bozeman,why did it change course?

DATA:
According to our current information, the destruction of the Amargosa star has had the following effects in this sector: gamma emissions have increased by .05 percent, the starship Bozeman was forced to make a course correction, a research project on Gorik IV was halted due to increased neutrino particles, ambient magnetic fields have decreased by-

DATA:
Guilt. It is a most unpleasant feeling.

PICARD:
No. And what you must try to avoid is becoming consumed by another emotion which I believe you're beginning to experience: guilt.

DATA:
But I did not deal with it, sir. I let it prevent me from helping my friend. Does that make me a coward?

PICARD:
Fear is a very difficult emotion to overcome. It's something we all have to learn to deal with.

DATA:
I wanted to save Geordi. I tried. But I experienced something I did not expect. I believe it was fear.

PICARD:
What do you mean?

DATA:
No, sir. I am finding it difficult to concentrate. I believe I am overwhelmed with feelings of remorse and regret concerning my actions on the observatory.

PICARD:
Data, are you all right?

DATA:
It will take a few moments for the computer to compile the information.

PICARD:
Give me a list of those effects. I want to know every single thing which has been altered or changed, no matter how insignificant.

DATA:
The star's destruction has had numerous astrophysical effects within this sector. However, none of them appear to have a connection to the energy ribbon.

PICARD:
Guinan said Soran was trying to get back to the ribbon. If that's true, then there must be some connection with the Amargosa star.

DATA:
Sorry, Captain. The ribbon has already entered the galaxy. It will pass through this sector in approximately thirty-one hours.

PICARD:
Data?

PICARD:
When is it expected back?

DATA:
According to our information, the ribbon is a conflux of temporal energy which travels through our galaxy every 39.1 years

DATA:
One minute to warp core breach.

LA FORGE:
That's it, Bridge- we're all out!

LA FORGE:
We better get you back to the ship La Forge to Enterprise.

DATA:
I believe the emotional chip has overloaded my positronic relays.

LA FORGE:
Data, are you all right?

DATA:
I am sorry, but I cannot stop myself. I think something is wrong

LA FORGE:
Data, this isn't the time.

DATA:
It appears to be a magnetically sealed.

LA FORGE:
I don't see a control panel, or an access port.

LA FORGE:
Thanks.

DATA:
I know. I just got it. It was very funny.

LA FORGE:
The Farpoint mission? Data, that was seven years ago.

DATA:
During the Farpoint mission. We were on the Bridge and you told a joke. That was the punchline.

LA FORGE:
What?

LA FORGE:
You get what?

DATA:
I get it. I get it.

DATA:
I am uncertain. I have had little experience with emotions. I am unable to articulate the sensation.

LA FORGE:
Really? What do you feel?

DATA:
I believe the beverage has provoked an emotional response.

LA FORGE:
Well?

DATA:
Agreed.

LA FORGE:
But at the first sign of trouble, I'm going to deactivate it. Agreed?

DATA:
That is true. However, I believe my growth as an artificial lifeform has reached an impasse. For thirty-four years I have endeavored to become more "human"- to grow beyond my original programming. And yet I am still unable to grasp such a simple concept as humor. This emotion chip is the only answer.

LA FORGE:
Wait a minute. I thought you've always been afraid it would overload your neural net.

DATA:
It has occurred to me on several occasions. But I believe this may be the appropriate time.

LA FORGE:
Data, you're not thinking about using that thing are you?

DATA:
I was attempting to get in the spirit of things. I thought it would be humorous.

LA FORGE:
No, but I'd stay out of Sickbay for a while if I were you. I still don't know why you dropped her in the water.

DATA:
Is she still angry?

RIKER:
All hands, brace for impact!

DATA:
I have rerouted auxiliary power to the lateral thrusters- attempting to level our descent.

DATA:
Perhaps. Yes! If we sent a low-level ionic pulse, it might reset the coil and engage the cloaking systems.

RIKER:
Could we access the defective coil and trigger their cloak?

DATA:
I hope so, sir.

RIKER:
We all are, Data. But we're going to get him back.

DATA:
I am quite...preoccupied with concern about Geordi.

RIKER:
Looks like you're stuck with emotions for a while. How do you feel?

RIKER:
The station complement was nineteen.

DATA:
Sensors show five life signs aboard the station, Captain.

DEMORA:
There's some buckling on the starboard nacelle. We've also got a hull breach in the Engineering section. Emergency forcefields are in place and holding.

HARRIMAN:
You did it, Kirk! Damage report, Ensign.

HARRIMAN:
I'll go. You have the Bridge.

DEMORA:
Deck 15, section 21-alpha.

HARRIMAN:
Beam them directly to Sickbay.

DEMORA:
We're within range, sir.

HARRIMAN:
On screen.

DEMORA:
We're within visual range of the energy distortion, Captain.

HARRIMAN:
Signal the closest starship. We're in no condition to mount a rescue. We don't even have a full crew aboard.

DEMORA:
The ships are bearing at 3-1-0 mark 2-1-5. Distance: three light years.

HARRIMAN:
Can you locate them?

GUINAN:
I can't leave. I'm already there, remember?

PICARD:
You're right. I'll need help. Guinan, will you come back with me? Together, we could-

GUINAN:
What makes you think things will be any different this time?

PICARD:
I know exactly where I want to go, and when. Back to that mountaintop on Veridian III, before Soran put out the star. I have to stop him.

GUINAN:
I told you, time has no meaning here. If you leave, you can go anywhere, any time.

PICARD:
I don't understand.

GUINAN:
Yes, where would you go?

PICARD:
Can I?

GUINAN:
Why would you want to leave?

PICARD:
Guinan, can I leave the Nexus?

GUINAN:
Yeah. They're great, aren't they? You can go back and see them born, go forward and see your grandchildren. Time has no meaning here.

PICARD:
These are my children...my children.

GUINAN:
Wherever he wanted to be.

PICARD:
Where is he now?

GUINAN:
All of us.

PICARD:
Soran?

GUINAN:
When the Enterprise-B beamed us off the Lakul, we were partially in the Nexus. The transporters locked on to us, but somehow everyone left a part of themselves behind.

PICARD:
Left behind?

GUINAN:
I am on the Enterprise. I am also here. Think of me as an "echo" of the person you know. A part she left behind.

PICARD:
Guinan, what are you doing here? I thought you were on the Enterprise.

GUINAN:
Enjoy them, Jean-Luc.

PICARD:
But I never had a wife, children, a home like this.

GUINAN:
For you. This is where you wanted to be.

PICARD:
This is the Nexus?

GUINAN:
You're in the Nexus.

PICARD:
Guinan, what's going on? Where am I?

PICARD:
But why destroy a star? Thank you, Guinan.

GUINAN:
Soran may still be obsessed with getting back. And if he is, he'll do anything to find that doorway again.

PICARD:
Your "sixth sense"- I've always wondered where it came from. And what about Soran?

GUINAN:
It took a long time, but eventually I learned to live with it. And I began to realize that my experience in the Nexus had changed me. I knew things about people, about events, about time.

GUINAN:
I can't remember very much - what it looked like or how long I was there. But I do remember how it felt.

PICARD:
What happened to you?

GUINAN:
That ribbon isn't just some random energy phenomenon travelling through space. It's a doorway. It leads to another place- the Nexus. It doesn't exist in our universe and it doesn't play by the same rules either.

PICARD:
What's the "Nexus"?

GUINAN:
Soran doesn't care about power or weapons. All he cares about is getting back to the Nexus.

PICARD:
Guinan. It's important that you tell me what you know. We think Soran's developed a weapon...a terrible weapon. It might give him enough power to-

GUINAN:
Oh yes. I remember everyone who was on the Lakul, every face. Even the ones who didn't make it.

PICARD:
Do you remember him?

KIRK:
Risk is part of the game if you want to sit in that chair.

HARRIMAN:
What about the gravimetric distortions? They'll tear us apart.

HARRIMAN:
It won't be installed until Tuesday. Ensign Sulu, try generating a subspace field around the ships. That might break them free.

KIRK:
You left spacedock without a tractor beam?

HARRIMAN:
We don't have a tractor beam.

HARRIMAN:
Please, I insist.

KIRK:
No, no. Thank you.

HARRIMAN:
Prepare to leave spacedock. Aft thrusters ahead one quarter, port and starboard at station keeping. Captain Kirk, I'd be honored if you would give the order to get underway.

KIRK:
Oh, of course.

HARRIMAN:
Excuse me, gentlemen, if you'll take your seats.

HARRIMAN:
Please, please.

KIRK:
Well, may we have a look around?

KIRK:
It's our pleasure.

HARRIMAN:
I'm Captain John Harriman. I'd like to welcome you all aboard.

KIRK:
Least I could do for a captain of the Enterprise.

PICARD:
Yes. Thank you.

KIRK:
Did we do it? Did we make a difference?

PICARD:
I'll find a way to contact the Enterprise. You're going to be all right.

KIRK:
Of course, if Spock were here, he'd say I was being an irrational, illogical human for wanting to go on a mission like that.

PICARD:
You could say that.

KIRK:
I take it the odds are against us and the situation is grim?

PICARD:
That's right.

KIRK:
How can I argue with the captain of the Enterprise? What was the name of that planet Veridian III?

PICARD:
I hadn't planned on it.

KIRK:
Close to retirement?

PICARD:
That's right.

KIRK:
Captain of the Enterprise, huh?

KIRK:
She's not real either, is she? Nothing here is. Nothing here matters.

PICARD:
Antonia?

KIRK:
This is my uncle's barn in Iowa.

PICARD:
Better?

KIRK:
No, no, it's not. It's better.

KIRK:
I don't need to be lectured by you. I was out saving the galaxy when your grandfather was still in diapers. And frankly, I think the galaxy owes me one I was like you once- so worried about duty and obligations that I couldn't see anything past this uniform. And in the end, what did it get me? Nothing. Not this time.

PICARD:
You're a Starfleet officer and you have a duty to-

KIRK:
You said history considers me dead. Who am I to argue with history?

KIRK:
Temporal nexus, yeah, I heard you. Something's missing.

PICARD:
Not exactly. As I said, this is some kind of-

KIRK:
So you're telling me this is the 24th-century, and I'm dead?

PICARD:
I'm from what you would consider the future; the 24th-century.

KIRK:
This clock, I gave this clock to Bones.

PICARD:
Yes, yes, it is.

KIRK:
Beautiful day, isn't it?

SCOTTY:
Captain, I don't know how much longer I can hold her together!

KIRK:
Kirk here.

SCOTTY:
I always do.

KIRK:
Keep her together until I get back.

KIRK:
Where are the deflector relays?

SCOTTY:
Captain, it may be possible to simulate a torpedo blast using a resonance burst from the main deflector dish.

KIRK:
Load torpedo bays, prepare to fire on my command.

SCOTTY:
Aye.

KIRK:
A photon torpedo?

SCOTTY:
An anti-matter discharge directly ahead it might disrupt the field long enough for us to break away.

KIRK:
I thought you might.

SCOTTY:
But I do have a theory...

SCOTTY:
There's just no way to disrupt a gravimetric field of this magnitude!

KIRK:
The first thing you learn as captain is how to cheat death. Scotty?

KIRK:
Phasing? To where?

SCOTTY:
Their life signs are are phasing in and out of our space-time continuum.

SCOTTY:
It's like you always said- if something's important enough, you make the time.

KIRK:
Sulu. When did he find the time for a family?

SCOTTY:
And what would that be, sir?

KIRK:
You know, Scotty, it amazes me.

KIRK:
When I retired, I swore I'd never set foot on a starship again, and I meant it.

SCOTTY:
What do you mean, you're not going? We promised.

KIRK:
I'm not going Scotty, help me with this chute.

SCOTTY:
I've warned ye about that back of yours. You should have a doctor take a look at it.

KIRK:
Oh

LA FORGE:
I told you everything. You might as well just kill me right now.

SORAN:
We learn something new about ourselves every day. Now. Maybe I didn't make myself clear. It is very important that you tell me exactly what Captain Picard knows.

LA FORGE:
No, I didn't know that.

SORAN:
I just stopped your heart for five seconds. It felt like an eternity, didn't it? Did you know that you can stop the human heart for up to ten minutes before the onset of brain damage?

LA FORGE:
Yeah, they're full of great ideas.

SORAN:
Oh, I forgot to tell you. While you were unconscious, I injected a nano-probe into your bloodstream. It's been navigating your cardiovascular system, and right now I've attached it to your left ventricle. A little trick I picked up from the Borg.

LA FORGE:
Guinan? I don't know what you're talking about.

SORAN:
What about Guinan? What has she told you about me?

LA FORGE:
No.

SORAN:
Let's try to move beyond the usual prisoner-interrogator banter, shall we? You have information and I need it. Did the Captain explain his orders to you? Did he say why you were searching for trilithium?

LA FORGE:
I was ordered to by the Captain.

SORAN:
I don't want a science lecture. You were on that observatory looking for trilithium. Why?

LA FORGE:
What do you want?

SORAN:
Normal is what everyone else is, and what you are not.

LA FORGE:
What's normal?

SORAN:
A remarkable piece of equipment, but a little inelegant, wouldn't you say? Have you ever considered a prosthesis that would make you look a little more...normal?

PICARD:
You may still. Somehow I doubt this will be the last ship to carry the name Enterprise.

RIKER:
I always thought I'd have a crack at this chair one day.

PICARD:
Too big. How long until the ribbon arrives?

RIKER:
That's a pretty big margin of error.

PICARD:
They're just trying to decide whether a twenty year-old Klingon Bird of Prey is any match for the Federation flagship.

RIKER:
Maybe they're not out there.

PICARD:
How is that possible?

RIKER:
A quantum implosion has occurred within the Amargosa star. All nuclearfusion is breaking down.

PICARD:
Report.

PICARD:
No. Thank you.

RIKER:
Sir, is there anything wrong?

PICARD:
Understood. That will be all.

RIKER:
There is something else, Captain. One of the scientists, a Doctor Soran,has insisted on speaking with you. I told him you were busy, sir, but he said it was absolutely imperative that he speak with you right away.

PICARD:
Thank you, Number One.

RIKER:
No, sir.

PICARD:
Is there a problem?

RIKER:
You want me to contact Starfleet?

PICARD:
Hmm, Inform Starfleet Command. This could indicate a new Romulan threat in this sector.

RIKER:
We think they were looking for something- they practically tore the place apart.

PICARD:
There's still no indication of why they attacked the station?

PICARD:
Make it so.

RIKER:
Sir?

RIKER:
Bad food, brutal discipline. No women.

PICARD:
Imagine what it was like, Will. No engines, no computers, just the wind, the sea and the stars to guide you.

RIKER:
Aye, aye, sir. Take the wheel, Commander.

PICARD:
Well, now that we're all aboard Number One, bring the ship before the wind. Let's see what's out there.

RIKER:
When we went to ancient Rome for Deanna's promotion, we threw her to the lions, remember?

PICARD:
Don't you think you're taking this a little too far, Number One?

PICARD:
Mr. Data, scan the planet for lifeforms.

TROI:
Or perhaps they're on the surface.

TROI:
There's nothing selfish about pursuing your own life, your own career.

PICARD:
My brother had shouldered that burden, allowing me to pursue my own selfish needs.

TROI:
You felt it was no longer your responsibility to carry on the family line.

PICARD:
Ever since I was a little boy, I remember hearing about the family line. The Picards that fought at Trafalgar, the Picards that settled the first Martian colony. When my brother married and had a son...

TROI:
Your family history is very important to you, isn't it?

PICARD:
In a way, he was as close as I ever came to having a child of my own.

TROI:
It's only natural to feel a heightened sense of tragedy when a child dies. But it goes deeper than that, doesn't it? I can sense that Rene meant a great deal to you.

PICARD:
What I can't get out of my mind is the image of Rene- my nephew. I just can't believe he's gone.

TROI:
Captain, Im sorry. I know there were a lot of unresolved conflicts between you and your brother.

PICARD:
All right, all right. You've made your point.

TROI:
Very well. I suppose I could make out my weekly report to Starfleet Command without your input. "Admiral Lusby, regarding the unusual behavior of Jean-Luc Picard: I find him increasingly irritable, remote and uncooperative. I recommend forced shore leave at a Starbase facility in order to-"

PICARD:
Well, with all due respect to your Betazoid senses, I prefer to be alone right now.

TROI:
You can't fool an empath, Captain. I know exactly when I'm needed.

PICARD:
As ship's counselor, it's your duty to know not only when you're needed but also when you're not.

TROI:
I'm afraid I can't just leave it at that. The commanding officer of this ship is clearly distraught about something. As ship's counselor, it's my duty to-

PICARD:
Well, I appreciate your concern, but I'd rather not discuss it right now, thank you.

TROI:
Actually, I'm here to see if there's anything I can do for you.

PICARD:
Counselor. What can I do for you?

PICARD:
Yes. Fine. If you'll excuse me.

TROI:
Captain, are you all right?

PICARD:
Thank you.

SORAN:
Careful, Captain. That's a fifty gigawatt forcefield. I wouldn't want to see you get hurt.

SORAN:
Time has no meaning there. The predator has no teeth.

PICARD:
The Nexus.

SORAN:
What if I told you I found a new truth?

PICARD:
We're all mortal, Soran. It's one of the truths of ou existence.

PICARD:
Not if it means killing over two hundred million people. I wonder, did your wife Leandra know that she married a man who was capable of mass murder?

SORAN:
I've spent eighty years looking for another way, Captain. This is the only one. Of course, you could always come with me. You fancy yourself an explorer. Here's a chance to explore something no human has ever experienced.

SORAN:
The only possible reason you're here is because you're not entirely confident you can shoot down my probe after all. So you've come to dissuade me from my horrific plan. Good luck.

PICARD:
The thought had crossed my mind.

SORAN:
You must think I'm quite the madman.

PICARD:
We're doing the best we can. Now if you'll excuse me...

SORAN:
The timing is very important on my experiment- if it is not completed within the next twelve hours, years of research will be lost.

PICARD:
Doctor, we're still conducting an investigation into the attack. Once we've completed our work, we'll be happy to allow you and your fellow scientists back aboard the observatory. Until then-

SORAN:
Yes. I need to return to the observatory immediately. I must continue a critical experiment I was running on the Amargosa star.

PICARD:
Nothing for me. I understand there's something urgent you need to discuss with me.

SORAN:
Yes, yes, Captain. Thank you for coming.

PICARD:
Doctor Soran?

RIKER:
We're only going to get one shot at this. Target their primary reactor. With any luck, their warp core should implode.

WORF:
Aye, sir.

RIKER:
Worf, prepare a spread of photon torpedoes. We'll have to hit them the instant they begin to cloak.

RIKER:
Right. And they'll be vulnerable for at least two seconds. Data,lock onto that plasma coil.

WORF:
As their cloak begins to engage, their shields will drop.

WORF:
I do not see how. The plasma coil is part of their cloaking device.

RIKER:
Plasma coils...is there any way we can use that to our advantage?

WORF:
It is a Class D-12 Bird of Prey. They were retired from service because of defective plasma coils.

RIKER:
Lock phasers and return fire!

WORF:
They have found a way to penetrate our shields.

RIKER:
Lursa and B'Etor? This doesn't make any sense. A renowned stellar physicist somehow uses a trilithium probe to destroy a star, kidnaps Geordi and escapes with a pair of Klingon renegades. Why? What the hell's going on?

WORF:
I have spoken to the Klingon High Council, sir. They identified the Bird of Prey as belonging to the Duras sisters.

RIKER:
The star's going to collapse in a matter of minutes.

WORF:
Sensor records show a solar probe was launched from the observatory a few moments ago.

WORF:
Aye, sir.

RIKER:
Have Geordi and Data go over with the next Away Team. Tell them to scan the observatory for trilithium.

RIKER:
Why were they looking for it on a Federation observatory? It doesn't make any sense.

WORF:
An experimental compound the Romulans have been working on. In theory, a trilithium-based explosive would be thousands of times more powerful than an anti-matter weapon. But they never found a way to stabilize it.

RIKER:
Trilithium?

WORF:
One of the dead Romulans had a tricorder. We analyzed its sensor logs and found they were scanning for signature particles of a compound called trilithium.

RIKER:
Well, that narrows it to Klingon, Breen or Romulan.

WORF:
These blast patterns are consistent with Type III disruptors.

WORF:
There are no other ships in the system.

RIKER:
It looks like we're too late.

RIKER:
You see the top yardarm, now look to the-

WORF:
The royal...studs?

PICARD:
The "mighty" Federation could learn a few things from this village...

ANIJ:
Do you really think your mighty Federation would be interested in protecting six hundred people?

ANIJ:
I'll be here.

PICARD:
But I have three hundred and eighteen days of vacation time coming. I plan on using them.

PICARD:
I thought it might begin the healing process.

ANIJ:
Mother and son. You arranged this...?

PICARD:
You've brought the Federation into the middle of a blood feud, Admiral. The children have returned to expel their elders... just as they were once expelled. Except Ru'afo's need for revenge has now escalated to parricide.

ANIJ:
You're Ro'tin, aren't you...? There's something in the voice. Would you be his friend Gal'na? I helped your mother bathe you when you were a child. She still speaks of you.

PICARD:
This way!

ANIJ:
There's a cavern at the base of the next hill...

PICARD:
I should warn you... I've always been attracted to older women...

ANIJ:
What's the rush?

PICARD:
How is it a woman like you never married? And don't tell me you "just haven't gotten around to it yet"...

PICARD:
By now the Son'a have scanned the area and know that just as well as we do.

ANIJ:
Right beyond that ridge is where the caves begin... we can hide for days...

PICARD:
Roughly translated: puberty... although for a Klingon that's not doing it justice... Any severe mood swings, unusual aggressive tendencies -- be sure to let me know right away...

ANIJ:
Jak'tahla?

PICARD:
We can hold them off a long time... once we get there... But they will not make it easy to get there...

ANIJ:
There are caves in those mountains.

PICARD:
When we're forced away by the terrain, we'll use transport inhibitors to compensate. The mountains have the highest concentrations. Once we're there, transport will be virtually impossible...

ANIJ:
For someone so young.

PICARD:
... an offlander?

ANIJ:
I wonder if you're aware of the trust you endanger, Jean-Luc Picard. In my experience, it's unusual for...

ANIJ:
I just... haven't gotten around to it yet.

PICARD:
There's one thing I don't understand. In three hundred years...you never learned to swim?

ANIJ:
It took us centuries to learn that it doesn't have to take centuries to learn.

PICARD:
I wish I could spare a few centuries to learn.

ANIJ:
Yes. Exactly. Nothing more complicated than perception. You explore the universe. We've discovered a single moment in time can be a universe in itself... full of powerful forces... most people aren't aware enough of the now... to ever notice them...

PICARD:
Seeing my home planet from space for the first time...

ANIJ:
When time seemed to stop... and you could almost live in that moment...

PICARD:
A perfect moment?

ANIJ:
You'll stop reviewing what happened yesterday... stop planning for tomorrow... until you find... Let me ask you a question -- have you ever experienced a perfect moment in time?

PICARD:
Will it?

ANIJ:
More questions. Always the explorer. If you stay long enough, that'll change.

PICARD:
An apprentice for thirty years. We've noticed your people's mental discipline. Did that develop here?

ANIJ:
This is a school... that's a student's work. She'll be ready to become an apprentice soon. Then, in thirty or forty years, she'll take her place among the artisans...

PICARD:
The craftsmanship is extraordinary.

PICARD:
You give me more credit than I deserve. Of course, I'm tempted. Who wouldn't be? But some of the blackest marks in the history of my world have involved the forced relocation of a small group of people to satisfy the demands of a larger one. I'd like to believe we learn from our mistakes. Obviously, some of us haven't.

ANIJ:
... who wouldn't be tempted by the promise of perpetual youth? I don't think so.

PICARD:
In defense of offlanders, there are many more like me...

ANIJ:
You don't live up to your reputation as an offlander, Picard.

PICARD:
There are days.

ANIJ:
But not you.

PICARD:
Most of my people who live that faster pace would sell their souls to slow it down.

ANIJ:
We've always known that to survive, we had to remain apart. It hasn't been easy. Many of the young people here want to know more about the offland... they're attracted to stories of a faster pace of life...

PICARD:
Clearly, the architects of this conspiracy have tried to keep it a secret. Not just from you, but from my people as well. I don't intend to let them.

PICARD:
We've... just begun to. I suppose you're seventy-five.

ANIJ:
There's an unusual metaphasic radiation coming from the planet's rings. It continuously regenerates the cells in our bodies. You must have noticed the effects by now.

ANIJ:
I've been shot at... thrown into the lake out of an invisible ship that's come to abduct us all... what's there to panic about?

PICARD:
Don't panic...

PICARD:
To move you off this planet. You go to sleep one night in your village... wake up the next morning in this flying holodeck transported en masse. A week later, maybe a month, you've been relocated on a similar planet without ever realizing it.

ANIJ:
Deceive us?

PICARD:
Data, if you were following the boy and discovered this ship...

ANIJ:
I know what a hologram is, Captain. The question is -- why would someone want to create one of our village?

ANIJ:
Then you must spend your life answering questions.

PICARD:
I don't like to leave questions unanswered.

ANIJ:
Why?

PICARD:
I understand how you feel. We just want to retrace Data's movements that day...

ANIJ:
Capability, yes. But where can warp drive take us, except away from here...?

PICARD:
You have warp capability?

PICARD:
If I were in your shoes, I'd feel the same way after what happened. The 'artificial lifeform' is a member of my crew. Apparently, he became... ill...

ANIJ:
Your directive apparently doesn't include spying on other cultures.

PICARD:
My people have a strict policy of non-interference with other cultures. In fact, it's our Prime Directive.

ANIJ:
It's not our custom to have guests here at all, let alone hold anyone against their will.

PICARD:
We were under the impression they were being held against their will.

ARTIM:
Bye.

DATA:
I have to go home now.

DATA:
It is safer there. I will join you shortly.

ARTIM:
No... I want to stay with you...

DATA:
Tournel will take you the rest of the way...

ARTIM:
Anij!

ARTIM:
If you want to know 'what it's like to be a child', you need to learn how to play...

DATA:
No one's ever asked me that before.

ARTIM:
Why not...?

DATA:
Androids... don't have...fun.

ARTIM:
Data... haven't you ever just played... for fun?

DATA:
But I can run much faster than you... I am capable of exceeding forty-seven meters per second...

ARTIM:
Because you're it. And if you tag me... then I'm it.

DATA:
For what purpose?

ARTIM:
Chase me!

ARTIM:
No, I mean...

DATA:
I play the violin... and my chess routines are quite advanced...

ARTIM:
Do machines ever play?

DATA:
I would gladly accept the requirement of a bedtime in exchange for knowing what it is like to be a child.

ARTIM:
But you've never had adults telling you what to do all the time... or bedtimes... or having to eat food you don't like...

DATA:
My legs are eighty-seven-point- two centimeters. They were eighty-seven-point-two centimeters the day I was created. They will be eighty- seven-point-two centimeters the day I go off line. My operation depends on specifications that do not change. I... cannot imagine... the experience of growing up or even tripping over my own feet...

ARTIM:
Sometimes I do.

DATA:
But they are in a constant state of growth. Do you find it difficult to adapt? A child's specifications are never the same from one moment to the next. I am surprised that you do not... trip over your own feet.

ARTIM:
For one thing, your legs are shorter than everyone else's.

DATA:
Really.

ARTIM:
Really?

DATA:
Perhaps it would surprise you to know that I have often tried to imagine what it would be like to be a child...

ARTIM:
I can't imagine what it would be like to be a machine.

DATA:
My power cells continually re- charge themselves.

ARTIM:
Don't you ever get tired?

DATA:
Perhaps, that is true.

ARTIM:
I know why. So people like us won't be afraid of you any more.

DATA:
I aspire to be more than I am.

ARTIM:
Not everyone here agrees with him. I mean, you know, about machines. There was even a big fight about it once. Do you like being a machine?

ARTIM:
I don't.

DATA:
I understand.

ARTIM:
My father told me I shouldn't talk to you.

DATA:
I am better.

ARTIM:
You're what?

DATA:
There is no need for concern. I am operating within normal parameters now.

PICARD:
If not for Data, you'd probably have been re-located by now.

ARTIM:
The artificial lifeform was right?

PICARD:
To many offlanders, what you have here would be more valuable than gold-pressed latinum. And I'm afraid it's the reason that someone is trying to take this world away from you.

PICARD:
No.

ARTIM:
Won't he rust?

PICARD:
Data doesn't breathe.

ARTIM:
Can he breathe under water?

PICARD'S COM VOICE:
Very good, Doctor. Picard out.

CRUSHER:
Not at all. They're fine... in fact, they're better than fine. Increased metabolism, high energy, improved muscle tone. We should all be so lucky.

PICARD'S COM VOICE:
Are they in any danger?

CRUSHER:
They all have slightly elevated levels of endorphin production... probably the result of the environmental anomalies here...

PICARD'S COM VOICE:
And our people?

CRUSHER:
Captain, the Son'a hostages declined to be examined. I had them confined to quarters.

CRUSHER:
Safer than leaving her here.

PICARD:
Is it safe to move her?

CRUSHER:
She's stabilizing.

CRUSHER:
Yes. But look at this medscan...

PICARD:
Will he live?

CRUSHER:
They should be quarantined before joining the ship's population.

PICARD:
Prepare to transport the 'hostages' to the ship...

CRUSHER:
Your Captain used to cut quite a rug...

PICARD:
Very funny...

CRUSHER:
Sure it is. And your hair is still chestnut brown.

PICARD:
'Yew-cheen chef-faw'... My collar size is exactly the same as it was at the Academy.

CRUSHER:
You either need a new uniform or a new neck.

DATA:
I believe it is safe, sir.

PICARD:
Will the structure hold if we blast through?

DATA:
I'm showing fresh air behind this calcite formation, Captain...

DATA:
Another forty-three people reported taken, sir...

PICARD:
How many?

PICARD:
Good. Let's begin to move these people out...

DATA:
Captain, I've activated transport inhibitors around the village...

PICARD:
I don't know.

DATA:
Why would the Federation or the Son'a wish to move the Ba'ku?

PICARD:
What possible purpose could a duplicate village have except... to deceive the Ba'ku...

DATA:
... it is conceivable I was shot to protect the secret of its existence.

PICARD:
What you're seeing is a computer driven image created by photons and forcefields...

DATA:
Incomplete, I might add.

PICARD:
'Just a few loose ends to tie up.'

DATA:
It is clearly Federation in origin, Captain.

PICARD:
A ship,

PICARD:
How about a passive radiation scan?

DATA:
Tricorder functions are limited due to heavy deposits of kelbonite in these hills...

DATA:
And I do not believe I made a very good first impression.

PICARD:
Until this week, that young man probably never saw a machine, let alone one that walks and talks...

DATA:
... I am the personification of everything they have rejected.

PICARD:
It's nothing personal data. You have to remember these people have rejected technology. And you...

DATA:
I believe the boy is... afraid... of me.

DATA:
I was in an isolation suit collecting physiometric data on Ba'ku children. My last memory is going into the hills, following a boy...

PICARD:
From the mission...

DATA:
'his nose should pant and his lip should curl...'

PICARD:
What's the last thing you remember, Data...

DATA:
Yes... that looks like them.

PICARD:
You're aboard the Enterprise.

DATA:
Captain, Geordi...?

PICARD:
Hello, Data...

DOUGHERTY:
If you begin the procedure while the planet is still populated, the Federation will pursue you until...

RU'AFO:
I do not take orders from you.

DOUGHERTY:
It is over.

RU'AFO:
It is not over.

DOUGHERTY:
We're taking this ship out of here... this mission is over...

RU'AFO:
In six hours, every living thing in this system will be dead or dying.

DOUGHERTY:
You're not going to launch anything until...

RU'AFO:
Picard's first officer. Do you really believe he'll listen?

DOUGHERTY:
I'll order Riker to turn around.

RU'AFO:
Federation support, Federation procedures, Federation rules... look in the mirror, Admiral... the Federation is old... in the last twenty four months, it's been challenged by every major power in the quadrant -- the Borg, the Cardassians, the Dominion... they all smell the scent of death on the Federation. That's why you've embraced our offer... because it will give your dear Federation new life. Well, how badly do you want it, Admiral? Because there are hard choices to be made now. If the Enterprise gets through with news about their brave Captain's valiant struggle on behalf of the defenseless Ba'ku, your Federation politicians will waver, your Federation opinion polls will open a public debate, your Federation allies will want their say... need I go on?

DOUGHERTY:
That is not an acceptable option. If people get hurt, all the support we have in the Federation...

RU'AFO:
Talk... we should send down an assault team and take them by force.

DOUGHERTY:
Take me down. Let me talk to Picard.

DOUGHERTY:
He's right. Our shields have been upgraded to protect against the environmental anomalies...

RU'AFO:
It isn't safe for you to remain in this area.

DOUGHERTY:
I know what Data means to Starfleet, Jean-Luc... but our crew is at the mercy of those people on the planet...

RU'AFO:
Your android has turned dangerously violent, Captain... Considerable damage was done to my ship. He must be destroyed.

DOUGHERTY:
I prefer to wait until we can share the benefits with all the people of the Federation...

RU'AFO:
Your self-restraint puzzles me, Admiral. You continue to deny yourself every benefit this mission has to offer...

DOUGHERTY:
Another time.

RU'AFO:
Take us into a high orbit. Lie down, Admiral. The girls will take twenty years off your face...

RU'AFO:
Planet's population. Six hundred people. You want to avoid unnecessary risks? Next time leave your android home.

DOUGHERTY:
Our procedures were in place to protect the planet's population from unnecessary risk...

RU'AFO:
Your Federation procedures have made this mission ten times as difficult as it needed to be...

DOUGHERTY:
There's nothing further to be gained from this...

PICARD:
I wonder... which one of us will be facing that court-martial...

PICARD:
If a court-martial is the only way to tell the people of the Federation what happened here, then I welcome it.

DOUGHERTY:
Order them to surrender, and I promise you won't be court- martialed.

PICARD:
How many people would it take... before it becomes wrong? A thousand? Fifty thousand. A million?

DOUGHERTY:
We are only moving six hundred people, Jean-Luc.

PICARD:
We are betraying the principles upon which the Federation was founded... this is an attack on the very soul of the Federation. This will destroy the Ba'ku. Just as cultures have been destroyed in every other forced relocation throughout history.

PICARD:
The Ba'ku.

DOUGHERTY:
It would take ten years of normal exposure to begin to reverse their condition. Some of them won't survive that long. Besides, they don't want to live in the middle of The Briar Patch... who would?

PICARD:
Then the Son'a can establish a separate colony on this planet until we do...

DOUGHERTY:
Our best scientific minds already have. We can't find any other way to do this.

PICARD:
Delay the procedure. Let my people look at the technology.

DOUGHERTY:
The concentration in the rings is what makes the whole damned thing work. Don't ask me to explain it. I only know they inject something into the rings that starts a thermolytic reaction. After it's over, the planet will be unlivable for generations.

PICARD:
There are metaphasic particles all over The Briar Patch. Why must this planet be...

DOUGHERTY:
With metaphasics, lifespans will be doubled... an entire new medical science will evolve... I understand your Chief Engineer has the use of his eyes for the first time in his life... would you take his sight away from him?

PICARD:
Someone probably said the same thing about the Romulans a century ago.

DOUGHERTY:
On Earth, petroleum once turned petty thugs into world leaders. Warp drive transformed a bunch of Romulan thugs into an empire. We can handle the Son'a, I'm not worried about that...

PICARD:
Our partners are nothing more than petty thugs.

DOUGHERTY:
Right. We have the planet and they have the technology -- a technology we can't duplicate. You know what that makes us? Their partners.

PICARD:
A planet in Federation space...

DOUGHERTY:
There are six hundred people down there. We'll be able to use the regenerative properties of this radiation to help billions. The Son'a have developed a procedure to collect the metaphasic particles form the planets rings...

PICARD:
Who are we to decide the next course of evolution for these people?

DOUGHERTY:
The Prime Directive doesn't apply. These people are not indigenous to this world. They were never meant to be immortal. We'll simply be restoring their natural evolution.

PICARD:
How can there be an order to abandon the Prime Directive...?

DOUGHERTY:
I'm acting on orders form the Federation Council.

PICARD:
... or understand that they were participating in the outright theft of a world. I won't let you move them, Admiral. I'll go to the Federation Council...

DOUGHERTY:
That's why we put chromodynamic shields in place - so our people wouldn't feel the effects from the metaphasic radiation...

PICARD:
Your "Briar Patch" turned out to be more hospitable than I expected.

DOUGHERTY:
You're looking well, Jean-Luc. Rested.

DOUGHERTY:
Just a few loose ends to tie up. Dougherty out.

PICARD:
You're not finished here?

DOUGHERTY:
I'll need all your paperwork tomorrow. We're heading back your way. Set a course to rendezvous with us so you can transfer the crew and equipment on your way out.

PICARD:
In stasis. La Forge is completing the diagnostic.

DOUGHERTY:
You've done a terrific job, Jean- Luc. Now, pack your bags and get the hell out of there. How's Data?

PICARD:
... and because they have warp capabilities, the consequences to their society are minimal...

DOUGHERTY:
Good luck. Dougherty out.

PICARD:
Understood.

DOUGHERTY:
All right. You have twelve hours, Captain. Then I want you out of The Briar Patch. In the meantime, we'll be heading out to the perimeter to call for Son'a reinforcements in case you fail.

PICARD:
Sir, Commander Worf and I have been working on several tactical plans to safely...

DOUGHERTY:
I wish I had better news. Commander Data attacked us in the mission scout ship yesterday. Ru'afo and I have decided to send in an assault team...

PICARD:
This was too important for the Enterprise to be on the sidelines, Admiral...

DOUGHERTY:
Captain, I wasn't expecting you.

DOUGHERTY:
We haven't fully identified the anomalies yet. They're calling this whole area The Briar Patch... it took us a day to reach a location where we could get a signal out to you. Just get me Data's schematics. I'll keep you informed. Dougherty out.

PICARD:
What kind of concerns?

DOUGHERTY:
That's probably not a good idea. Your ship hasn't been fitted for this region; there are environmental concerns...

PICARD:
The Enterprise can be at your position in two days, Admiral...

DOUGHERTY:
... And now he's holding our people hostage down there...

PICARD:
You have no idea what precipitated his behavior?

PICARD:
Scan for lifesigns.

GALLATIN:
The countdown control has been transferred to the collector...I can't override...

PICARD:
What if he doesn't realize something's happening... Can you get me to a transmitter? I have to speak with Worf and Data on the surface... we'll need their help...

GALLATIN:
It doesn't matter where he is. As soon as he realizes something is happening, he'll override my commands with one word at his com- link...

PICARD:
If we could lure him away from the bridge...

GALLATIN:
But I would need at least three minutes on the bridge.

PICARD:
Do you know how to disable the injector?

GALLATIN:
What you're asking me to do... is impossible... the crew is loyal to Ru'afo...

PICARD:
I'm not begging for my life. I'm begging for yours. There is still a way home, Gal'na.

GALLATIN:
Is this how a Federation officer begs for his life?

PICARD:
A coward... without the moral courage to stop an unspeakable atrocity. You offend me.

RU'AFO:
Thank-you for reminding me.

GALLATIN:
The shields in that section won't protect them against the thermolytic reaction...

RU'AFO:
Separate the Starfleet personnel and secure them in the aft cargo hold... see that Picard joins them...

RU'AFO:
No one hated them more than you, Gal'na. We've come a long way together. This is the moment we've planned for so many years...

GALLATIN:
Moving them is one thing. Killing them all...

RU'AFO:
Deploy the collector.

GALLATIN:
May I talk to you alone?

RU'AFO:
Admiral Dougherty will not be joining us for diner. Deploy the collector. Do you have a problem with those orders?

RU'AFO:
We'd have to tag every one of them... that would take time... and we don't have it. The Enterprise is only nineteen hours from communications range with the Federation...

GALLATIN:
There is an alternative to an all- out assault. Isolinear tags would allow our transporters to lock on to them.

RU'AFO:
Recommendations?

GALLATIN:
They're following the kelbonite deposits... using the interference to block our transporters...

RU'AFO:
We're not waiting until morning... take the shuttles and get everyone off the surface tonight.

GALLATIN:
Sir, as the Enterprise left orbit, one of their support craft went down to the surface. It appeared to be the Captain's Yacht. Five persons on board.

RU'AFO:
The injector performs perfectly in every simulation...

RU'AFO:
I'm sure. Just don't forget what they did to us. We'll have them rounded up in a day or two... we needn't bother with the Federation holo-ship any more. Just get the holding cells ready.

GALLATIN:
No, sir. But it wasn't easy... being among them...

RU'AFO:
Gallatin! So the righteous Starfleet Captain finally released you. Did you encounter any problems on the surface?

LA FORGE:
It may not last after we leave. If not, I just wanted, before we go... I've never actually seen a sunrise.

PICARD:
... had regenerated.

LA FORGE:
Funniest thing, Captain. There wasn't anything wrong with my implants. There was something right with my eyes. When Doctor Crusher removed the ocular connections, she found the cells around my optic nerves...

LA FORGE:
It's nothing. I'm just tired.

PICARD:
Implants bothering you?

PICARD:
And yet he attacked us. And told the Ba'ku we were a threat...

LA FORGE:
In a sense, that's all he knew. The system is designed to protect him against anyone who might try to take advantage of his memory loss.

PICARD:
So, you're saying he still knew the difference between right and wrong.

LA FORGE:
His ethical and moral subroutines took over all of his basic functions...

PICARD:
Fail-safe?

LA FORGE:
All I know is that he was functioning normally until he was shot. Then, his fail-safe system was activated...

PICARD:
Why would they fire at him without provocation?

LA FORGE:
I don't believe it happened that way.

PICARD:
The Son'a reports claim they didn't fire until after he malfunctioned.

LA FORGE:
By a Son'a weapon. There's no doubt about it, sir. That's what made Data malfunction.

PICARD:
Do you know how they were damaged?

LA FORGE:
I took these out of Data's neural net... they contain memory engrams...

PICARD:
When I was an ensign, I could detect a three-micron mis- alignment...

LA FORGE:
The torque sensors are out of alignment... by twelve microns... you could hear that?

PICARD:
Do you have everything you need from command?

LA FORGE:
We're about to lose communications with Starfleet, Captain.

PICARD:
Are they...?

LA FORGE:
They... are in opposite directions, sir...

PICARD:
I want our guests to depart as quickly a etiquette allows. I'll ask Worf to delay his return to DS9 so he can join us. We're going to stop by sector four-four- one on our way to the Goren system.

LA FORGE:
Detonating the warp core might neutralize the cascade... but then again it might not. Subspace weapons are unpredictable. That's why they were banned.

RIKER:
That's your expert opinion?

LA FORGE:
You got me, Commander.

RIKER:
Will that stop the tear?

LA FORGE:
I'll be in Engineering.

RIKER:
If we don't outrun them, the manifolds are going to be the only thing left of this ship.

LA FORGE:
The manifold can't handle full impulse in the Patch, Commander.

RIKER:
Full impulse.

LA FORGE:
I think it's the universal greeting when you don't like someone.

RIKER:
A photon torpedo. Isn't that the universal greeting when communications are down?

LA FORGE:
Even if it doesn't, they'll be teaching kids as the Academy not to do this for years to come.

RIKER'S COM VOICE:
If it works you mean.

LA FORGE:
I wouldn't be surprised if history remembers this as the Riker Maneuver...

LA FORGE:
The purpose being...?

RIKER'S COM VOICE:
Negative. I want to use the ramscoop to collect as much of it as we can...

LA FORGE:
Aye, sir. Highly volatile...I recommend we keep our distance...

LA FORGE:
Eject the core.

RIKER'S COM VOICE:
Options?

LA FORGE:
We're pulling it like a zipper across space...

RIKER:
It's our only way out of here, Mister Nara.

NARA:
Commander, if one of their weapons hits that gas...

RIKER:
The purpose being I intend to shove it down the Son'a's throat.

RIKER:
Eject the core.

NARA:
The tear is closing on us... impact in fifteen seconds...

RIKER:
On screen.

NARA:
Sir, they've detonated an isolytic burst... a subspace tear is forming...

RIKER:
Why not?

NARA:
I don't think they believe us.

RIKER:
Blow out the ramscoop. Stand by full thrusters.

PERIM:
They're powering their forward weapons array.

RIKER:
We're through running from these bastards.

PERIM:
We're still thirty-six minutes from transmission range, sir.

RIKER:
Remind me to lodge a protest...

PERIM:
I thought subspace weapons were banned by the Khitomer Accord...

RIKER:
Yes, we do. You're relieved, Ensign. Take over at Ops.

PERIM:
Cometary debris, pockets of unstable metreon gas... we don't want to go in there, sir...

RIKER:
What's inside that nebula cluster?

PERIM:
Eighteen minutes...

RIKER:
How long 'til they reach us?

PERIM:
Commander, I'm showing two Son'a ships on an intercept course.

PICARD:
Top level review, my ass. There'll be no cover-up of this. Not after I get...

RIKER:
The Council has ordered a halt to the Ba'ku relocation while they conduct a top-level review.

RIKER:
Fat chance. I'll post it on every monitor on the ship...

PICARD:
There's a short letter I left you all, just some... sentimental nonsense... the computer will bring it to your attention at oh- four-hundred... I'd just as soon you delete it...

PICARD:
Go back to your quarters That's an order.

RIKER:
You must be planning on doing some hunting.

RIKER:
Aye, sir.

PICARD:
Prepare the ship for departure at oh-seven-hundred hours.

RIKER:
You Klingons never do anything small, do you...

PICARD:
Deck five.

PICARD:
We're not going anywhere.

RIKER:
Admiral Dougherty wants to know why we haven't left yet...

RIKER:
The only unusual readings were low levels of metaphasic radiation from interstellar dust across the region...

PICARD:
So where are the 'environmental concerns' the Admiral was talking about?

RIKER:
Nothing dangerous turned up in the astrometric survey...

PICARD:
We won't be able to go any faster than one-third impulse in that muck...

RIKER:
... and gorgonzolla cheese.

RIKER:
Commander Riker...

PICARD:
Who is it?

RIKER:
Deck ten.

PICARD:
'Yew-cheen chef-faw.'

PICARD:
... so they need us to put out one more brush fire. Anyone remember when we used to be explorers?

RIKER:
The Diplomatic Corps is busy with Dominion negotiations.

PICARD:
We can't delay the archaeological expedition to Hanoran Two. It would put us into the middle of monsoon season...

RIKER:
They need us to mediate some territorial dispute...

SOJEF:
I'm afraid there's too much bitterness... on both sides.

PICARD:
Ask them.

SOJEF:
I wish there was a way to bring them back home.

SOJEF:
Actually, I was a good deal older when we arrived... in terms of my physical condition.

PICARD:
You've not aged a day since then?

SOJEF:
We came here from a solar system on the verge of self- annihilation... where technology had created weapons that threatened to destroy all life. A small group of us set off to find a new home... a home that would be isolated from the threats of other worlds. That was three hundred and nine years ago.

SOJEF:
As you wish. But I would ask you to disarm yourselves. This village is a sanctuary of life.

PICARD:
No, we're here to... rescue them.

SOJEF:
Would you like something to eat?

PICARD:
Jean-Luc Picard... my officers Doctor Crusher and Counselor Troi.

SOJEF:
My name is Sojef, Captain.

PICARD:
I understand. Tell Doctor Crusher to have a hypospray of lectrazine ready...

WORF'S COM VOICE:
We're coming as fast as we can... we can't risk using phasers...

PICARD:
Worf, you must hurry...

WORF'S COM VOICE:
We're trying to get to you, sir...

PICARD:
Yes... yes, I... can hear you...

WORF'S COM VOICE:
Worf to Picard...

PICARD:
We'll skip the court martial this time... Picard out.

WORF'S COM VOICE:
I... I must have slept through my alarm. I'm on my way...

PICARD:
Slow to impulse. We're on our way.

WORF'S COM VOICE:
Bridge to Captain Picard. We are approaching sector four-four-one.

PICARD:
Is there any other way to disable the injector?

WORF:
Negative. He's established a security field around the control room...

PICARD:
Can you beam him off?

WORF:
One. It's Ru'afo.

PICARD:
Decloak the holo-ship and engage a tractor beam, Mister Worf.

WORF:
All injector sub-systems are confirmed off-line.

PICARD:
We have to find shelter...

WORF:
Isolinear tags. Their transporters can lock onto them.

PICARD:
Very well. We'll take an hour. Break out some rations...

WORF:
The Ba'ku could use some rest, sir. According to the geo-scan, this may be the safest area for the next few kilometers...

WORF:
Accelerated hair growth is often experienced by Klingons during Jak'tahla...

PICARD:
You need a haircut, Commander.

PICARD:
No. We'll be responsible for that, Mister Worf.

WORF:
Should I distribute phasers to the Ba'ku, sir...?

PICARD:
Picard to Crusher...

WORF:
Doctor Crusher asked to talk to you when you returned...

PICARD:
Gorch?

WORF:
No, sir. It is a gorch.

PICARD:
Debrief them again. Have you been in a fight, Commander?

WORF:
No, sir...

PICARD:
Did any of the hostages mention a cloaked ship during their debriefings?

PICARD:
Transferring controls to manual.

WORF:
The damping sequencer was damaged by phaser fire!

PICARD:
I'm not letting go of him.

WORF:
Sir, inertial coupling is exceeding tolerance... if we don't release him, he may destroy both vessels...

PICARD:
They're composers, Worf, from the nineteenth century. Data was rehearsing a part in H.M.S. Pinafore before he left... "A British tar is a soaring soul, As free as a mountain bird, His energetic first should be ready to resist A dictatorial word..."

WORF:
No, sir. I haven't had a chance to meet all the new crew members since I've been back...

PICARD:
Do you know Gilbert and Sullivan?

PICARD:
Evasive maneuvers... heading one- four-zero mark three-one...

WORF:
Scanners are off line!

PICARD:
Prepare to enter the atmosphere... we'll use the ionospheric boundary to shake him...

WORF:
He's activated a transport inhibitor.

PICARD:
Beam him out!

WORF:
Direct hit. He's resetting his shield harmonics...

PICARD:
Make it so.

WORF:
Sir, if we fire a tachyon burst, it may force him to reset his shield harmonics. When he does, we could beam him out...

PICARD:
Hmm? Oh, it's just something my mother used to...

WORF:
Sir?

PICARD:
Come out, come out wherever you are...

PICARD:
The metaphasic radiation in those rings is in a state of extreme flux. Steer clear of them, Mister Worf...

WORF:
He might be using the planet's rings to mask his approach.

PICARD:
Transmit a wide band co-variant signal. That'll get his attention.

WORF:
Sensors are not picking up any ships coming from the surface...

PICARD:
It's good to have you back, Worf. Slow to one-third. Take us in.

WORF:
I've already modified a tricorder with one of his spare actuation servos. Its operational range is only seven meters but it should shut him down...

PICARD:
Worf, what the hell are you doing here?

WORF:
Captain...

TROI:
They have an incredible clarity of perception, Captain. I've never encountered a species with such mental discipline...

PICARD:
Counselor?

PICARD:
You have two days to become experts... Mister Worf, your job and mine will be to find a plan to safely capture Data.

TROI:
We've downloaded all the files on the duck blind mission as well as intelligence reports on the Son'a.

PICARD:
Better have the chef whip up a light balsamic vinaigrette... something that goes well with chrysanthemums...

TROI:
Oh, my God, are they vegetarians? That's not in here...

TROI:
Yew-cheen chef-faw... emphasis on the 'cheen' and the 'faw'...

PICARD:
Say the greeting again...

TROI:
... Population three hundred million...

TROI:
And have you noticed how your boobs have started to firm up?

RIKER:
All hands. Battle stations!

TROI:
I never kissed you with a beard before.

RIKER:
Augh?

TROI:
Augh.

TROI:
On this ship, anything can happen. And usually does.

RIKER:
What I need, I can't get from Doctor Crusher... Counselor, do you think it's possible for two people to go back in time to fix a mistake they've made?

TROI:
... Doctor Crusher has something that'll take care of that...

RIKER:
... I'm not sleeping well...

TROI:
... I believe you...

RIKER:
Both. I think I'm having a mid-life crisis...

TROI:
You're in quite a mood today.

RIKER:
Or you could try lying down.

TROI:
Why don't you try sitting up?

RIKER:
But it's comfortable.

TROI:
This isn't one of the usual therapeutic postures...

TROI:
Whatever makes you comfortable...

RIKER:
Got a minute? I... need a little counseling. First time for everything. Do I... lie down... or what?

TROI:
Come in. Hi.

RIKER:
If that's true, they're a dying race.

TROI:
No children?

RIKER:
It says here that some form of genetic damage has apparently prevented the Son'a from procreating...

TROI:
Was I doing something to your neck?

RIKER:
What you're doing to my neck...

TROI:
What...?

RIKER:
You haven't done that in a long time...

RIKER:
Good question.

TROI:
Why would we be involved with these people?

RIKER:
You're in luck... it says here they've taken women from several races as indentured servants.

TROI:
Hmm, I should feel right at home with them...

RIKER:
Nomadic, collectors of precious metals, jewels...

TROI:
You should feel right at home with them.

RIKER:
Wine, women and song.

TROI:
What are they interested in...?

RIKER:
I don't see anything to suggest the Son'a have any interest in sociology...

TROI:
"Environmental concerns", again. An android could be safely exposed to the elements during the installation of a duck blind...

RIKER:
Why was Data assigned?

TROI:
The Son'a discovered an M-class planet with humanoid life six months ago. Turned out it's in us to get approval for a sociological study. The Federation Council suggested it be a joint mission...

RU'AFO:
Isolate one and re-route its command sequence through the auxiliary processor...

SON'A OFFICER #2:
They must have been locked and secured after we were beamed here.

RU'AFO:
This ship is equipped with fourteen long range transporters... are they all useless...?

SON'A OFFICER #2:
All ship functions are off-line.

RU'AFO:
Your scanners must be malfunctioning.

SON'A OFFICER #2:
Sir, I am not showing any change in metaphasic flux levels...

RU'AFO:
Exactly as the simulations predicted...

SON'A OFFICER #2:
Activating injector assembly.

RU'AFO:
Initiate launch sequence.

ADMIRAL HAYES:
I look forward to reading your report.

PICARD:
We're fine, sir. It will take some... time to explain.

ADMIRAL HAYES:
It's been destroyed. The Borg threat is over. Are you all right? The Enterprise disappeared from our sensors for a moment.

PICARD:
Admiral... what's the status of the Borg fleet?

PICARD:
Mister Data, set a pursuit course. Maximum warp.

ADMIRAL HAYES:
Good hunting. Hayes out.

PICARD:
Absolutely.

ADMIRAL HAYES:
The new quantum torpedoes are doing the trick, Jean-Luc. We've destroyed forty-seven Borg ships so far... and only lost fifteen of our own. But one of the Borg ships has broken through our defenses, and it's heading directly for Earth. Can you handle it?

BEVERLY:
I'd call them excuses. And the first excuse on both our lists was our "sense of duty." We convinced ourselves that it was more important than anything else. And you know what? It's not.

PICARD:
Beverly, there were many reasons why you and I...

BEVERLY:
You want some advice? Don't do this again. You know exactly what I mean.

PICARD:
Regardless of how I may feel about Ruby... our fates lie along different paths. Nothing can change that.

BEVERLY:
That might not be so bad... at least for you.

PICARD:
If they're not... we'd better get used to living in Montana.

BEVERLY:
You think they're still up there?

PICARD:
Not yet.

BEVERLY:
He was so confused by what I was doing, I don't think he even noticed. Any word from the Enterprise?

PICARD:
How did Doctor Almack react to that?

BEVERLY:
But I had a little help. Surgical transporter. I used it to beam out most of the bone fragments from his brain.

BEVERLY:
It was an experience. Metal scalpels... needle and thread...

PICARD:
You actually performed surgery...?

BEVERLY:
I'll be fine. He's a different story.

PICARD:
I have to go back to the silo. Will you be all right?

BEVERLY:
That'll be interesting.

PICARD:
Yes. But until then, you'll have to make do with what you've got.

BEVERLY:
He's stable... for now. But it would be better if we could contact... our friends.

PICARD:
Let's hope so. Because if Cochrane dies... the future may die with him.

BEVERLY:
There must be some good people... even in this time.

PICARD:
I'm saying they might shoot us on sight. You have to remember... these people have watched their entire way of life collapse around them.

BEVERLY:
Are you saying they won't help us?

PICARD:
It may not be that simple. This is an extremely difficult and paranoid time in human history.

BEVERLY:
What are we waiting for? Let's go.

PICARD:
As I recall, the town of Resurrection is about two kilometers East of here. They might have a hospital...

BEVERLY:
Jean-Luc, this man needs medical attention, now.

PICARD:
It's not the radiation... and there's nothing wrong with the combadges... the Enterprise just isn't responding.

BEVERLY:
I've stabilized him for now... but he's in a coma and he's going to need radiometric therapy. I want to take him to the ship.

PICARD:
It's Cochrane.

BEVERLY:
Well, why didn't you just say so in the first place?

PICARD:
I'm afraid so. If the Borg succeed in preventing First Contact with the Vulcans... Earth will remain in the Second Dark Age... an easy target when the Borg arrive in the 24th century.

BEVERLY:
But he's been dead for three hundred... Oh God... we've gone back in time again, haven't we?

PICARD:
Yes...

BEVERLY:
Cochrane... the inventor of warp drive?

PICARD:
We're here to find Zephram Cochrane. He may be injured or dead.

BEVERLY:
Go where? Hello? Is anyone going to tell me what we're doing here?

BEVERLY:
Montana? Well, that answers everything. Why the hell are we --

PICARD:
Montana. Energize.

DOCTOR:
I'm a little worried about some of these bone fragments. If they move any closer to the brain, we could be looking at a hemorrhage.

BEVERLY:
The occipital fracture is widening... we're going to have to fuse the bones...

DOCTOR:
Bag him.

BEVERLY:
His automatic reflexes are fluctuating. We've got to get him on a respirator.

DOCTOR:
We have two... but we don't have the juice to run them.

BEVERLY:
Um... yeah. Now he's going to need a respirator. Do you have one?

DOCTOR:
Is it Japanese?

BEVERLY:
At least four hours.

DOCTOR:
How long has he been unconscious?

BORG QUEEN:
Do it.

DATA:
I believe so.

BORG QUEEN:
Can you configure it?

DATA:
The problem must lie in the interface between Starfleet and Borg technology. Your console may not be configured to handle the data flow.

BORG QUEEN:
Your diagnostics are in error. I need weapons.

DATA:
No.

BORG QUEEN:
Vulcan?

DATA:
There is a perimeter alert. A ship has entered sensor range.

BORG QUEEN:
And I need to control this ship. Let me into your mind.

DATA:
No... no, it's so... empty... please... give it back... I need it...

BORG QUEEN:
... is to yourself. Don't make me hurt you again...

DATA:
Yes... but the Enterprise... my duty...

BORG QUEEN:
Isn't it better like this...?

DATA:
No... no, please... you cannot...

BORG QUEEN:
I've deactivated the sensory inputs. That flesh on your body is just meat, now.

BORG QUEEN:
Then take the final step... give me the Enterprise... and we can be together... always.

DATA:
Yes...

BORG QUEEN:
A universe of sensation is waiting for you... don't you want to explore it... with me?

DATA:
I am... grateful for what you have given me. But I still do not wish to be assimilated.

BORG QUEEN:
I'm your creator now.

DATA:
My creator did not intend for me to experience these things.

BORG QUEEN:
Have you ever know a woman? Do you know what it's like to feel her breath on your face... her skin against yours... flesh against flesh?

BORG QUEEN:
More lies.

DATA:
I wish to... go back to the way I was.

BORG QUEEN:
You're becoming more human all the time, Data. Now you're learning how to lie.

DATA:
I... do not want this...

BORG QUEEN:
Have they given you what I have given you? Did they even try?

DATA:
That is not true. They have tried to help me.

BORG QUEEN:
They're not your friends... they've held you back... kept you from your destiny...

DATA:
No. I will not betray my friends.

BORG QUEEN:
What a cold description... for such a beautiful gift.

DATA:
It would appear that you are attempting to graft organic skin onto my endo-skeletal structure.

BORG QUEEN:
Do you know what this is, Data?

BORG QUEEN:
That's because you haven't been properly... stimulated yet.

DATA:
I do not know what you are referring to.

BORG QUEEN:
You've taken your first step toward perfection. How does it feel?

DATA:
It is impossible to imagine sensations for which I have no frame of reference.

BORG QUEEN:
Have you ever wondered what it's like to have flesh?

BORG QUEEN:
Intelligence... ambition... desire... I bring order to chaos...

DATA:
You are the guiding intelligence behind the Borg...?

DATA:
Today is March second, 2063. The time in Montana is oh-eight-forty- five.

PICARD:
Mister Data, I want to know the exact date and time. Give me a damage report on that missile silo.

DATA:
According to our astrometric readings... the year is 2063.

PICARD:
What year is it?

PICARD:
Contact Starfleet Command.

DATA:
The vortex is collapsing, sir.

PICARD:
Where's the Sphere?

DATA:
I have helm control.

PICARD:
What?

DATA:
It has entered Earth orbit. Correction -- it is not in orbit. It is heading directly toward the surface.

PICARD:
Go to impulse. Where's the Borg ship?

DATA:
We are approaching the Terran System, Captain.

PICARD:
Ready quantum torpedo.

DATA:
The Borg ship has modified its shields, Captain. Our phasers will no longer be effective.

PICARD:
Bring us about. Target Borg ship alpha four, port side battery.

DATA:
Dispersive armor is holding.

WOMAN'S VOICE:
I am the beginning... the end. I am the one who is many. I am the Borg.

DATA:
That is a contradiction. The Borg act as a collective consciousness. There are no individuals.

WOMAN'S VOICE:
I am the Borg.

DATA:
Who are you?

WOMAN'S VOICE:
You are an imperfect being... created by an imperfect being. Finding your weakness is only a matter of time.

DATA:
I am unlike any lifeform you have encountered before. As an android, I am in complete control of my neural net. The information contained there cannot be forcibly removed.

WOMAN'S VOICE:
But now... they are all one with the Borg.

TROI:
I will admit... there are times when I wish I had an emotion chip I could turn on and off.

DATA:
No. Human beings do not have that luxury, and neither should I.

TROI:
We still have to make reports on ten more crewmen killed in action. Maybe you should deactivate your emotion chip until we're done.

DATA:
I am still having difficulty integrating certain emotions into my programming. Grief, loss, remorse...

TROI:
Data... are you sure you're all right?

DATA:
Not very well. We met shortly after the Enterprise-E was commissioned. I found her to be a most... promising officer.

TROI:
Did you know her?

TROI:
But how?

DATA:
The planet's surface is covered with Borg technology. So is the moon... and three other planets in this solar system.

PICARD:
Oh... just a little tinkering. How is he?

DOCTOR:
What did you do to the batteries?

DOCTOR:
Outside, around back. Next to the water tank.

PICARD:
Where?

DOCTOR:
I told you, there's no --

PICARD:
Where's the battery room for the hospital?

DOCTOR:
Power. There hasn't been a lot of wind through here for the last couple of weeks. Most of the batteries are depleted.

PICARD:
Juice?

PICARD:
Doctor Crusher has been... studying some advanced medical theories.

DOCTOR:
"APR cell count?" What the hell are you talking about?

PICARD:
We're crossing the threshold!

GEORDI:
They're getting awfully close... what the hell are they doing?

GEORDI:
Well, I feel a whole lot better with them out there. We may need some help.

PICARD:
Their com system must still be down.

PICARD:
Picard to Enterprise. Picard to Enterprise -- do you read me?

GEORDI:
Captain, the Enterprise!

PICARD:
One minute to warp threshold...

GEORDI:
There's no temporal shielding in here! We're starting to pick up relativistic effects!

PICARD:
Speed -- two hundred, seventy-five thousand kilometers per second.

GEORDI:
The inertial dampers are having trouble compensating... I don't think Cochrane built this thing for comfort.

GEORDI:
I'm on it...

PICARD:
Passing one-half light speed. The starboard nacelle's running a little hot...

PICARD:
Engage.

GEORDI:
The nacelles are charged... nuclear warhead standing by. We're ready to ignite the warp drive.

PICARD:
Bring the warp core on-line. I'll lay in a heading.

GEORDI:
The Vulcans should be out there right now. We need to break the warp barrier in the next five minutes if we're going to get their attention.

PICARD:
As they used to say... all systems are go.

GEORDI:
Ready to deploy the warp nacelles.

GEORDI:
Ignore it. We'll be fine. Prepare for first stage shut-down and separation on my mark...

PICARD:
There's a red light on the second intake valve.

GEORDI:
Entering the upper ionospere...

PICARD:
Altitude fifty kilometers...

GEORDI:
Solid rocket fuel at twenty-five thousand kilograms...

PICARD:
Get a tricorder. You're going to have to track my exact position in that room...

GEORDI:
What's still there?

PICARD:
Then we'll just have to assume it's still there...

GEORDI:
No... the door's too thick.

PICARD:
It'll have to wait. Come on.

GEORDI:
Captain... we've got less than ten minutes before that Vulcan ship leaves the system. We've got to go now.

PICARD:
This is Picard. I've suspended the launch sequence.

GEORDI:
Captain --

PICARD:
She's a very... determined woman. Phoenix to control. Mister Lange... let her in.

GEORDI:
Tell her to go back to Resurrection.

PICARD:
We can't leave her out there. When the ship launches... she'll be killed.

PICARD:
Phoenix to control. Initiating five minute countdown... mark.

GEORDI:
Always am.

PICARD:
Ready to make a little history?

GEORDI:
They used copper pipes in their plumbing... so I melted it down... and fused it with some tritanium from one of our phaser casings. It's not the strongest alloy... but it's better than all this crude aluminum and steel.

PICARD:
Where's you get the alloy for the throttle itself?

PICARD:
If there are other photographs... I think I may know how to find them.

GEORDI:
Maybe... Sure. Yeah. As long as I could get a clear look at the intake configuration. But so far, we haven't found any other photos.

GEORDI:
We're tearing this place apart looking for them... but the computers are down, and the fires destroyed half the files...so far, nothing.

PICARD:
We need to launch this ship in under eighteen hours... There must be some design schematics... blueprints...

GEORDI:
Yeah... if I knew what it looked like. There's probably five hundred ways to design a valve like this...

PICARD:
Can you reconstruct the throttle valve?

GEORDI:
This used to be the throttle valve assembly. It controls the thrust of the engines. It's been completely vaporized... and without it, there's no way to launch the ship.

GEORDI:
It could be the radiation, Captain. Try from the surface.

PICARD:
Picard to Enterprise. Enterprise, please respond.

PICARD:
There should be some kind of manual release...

GEORDI:
Blast door. It's designed to protect the control room when the missile is launched.

PICARD:
I have the password right here.

GEORDI:
Alphanumeric lock. We need a password to get in...

PICARD:
There should be an access hatch nearby...

GEORDI:
I'm picking up faint life signs twenty meters below.

PICARD:
Probably from the nuclear warhead. Cochrane was planning to use it to ignite the warp drive.

GEORDI:
I'm having trouble scanning underground. There's a lot of radiation leaking from something.

PICARD:
How serious is the damage?

GEORDI:
This must be it.

PICARD:
Let's go.

GEORDI:
I have the silo, sir. Bearing three one zero... distance, three hundred meters.

PICARD:
Understood. Keep me informed.

GEORDI:
Captain, I'm starting to worry about the hull integrity. We've been running the support field at full power for three hours straight. I don't know how much longer it's going to hold up.

GEORDI'S VOICE:
Initiate pre-ignition sequence.

PICARD'S VOICE:
Ready.

GEORDI'S VOICE:
Main bus...

PICARD'S VOICE:
Active.

GEORDI'S VOICE:
ATR setting...

PICARD'S VOICE:
Well, with any luck... the Vulcans will land outside Resurrection tomorrow morning... and Earth will never be the same again.

GEORDI'S VOICE:
I've enhanced the plasma injectors -- don't worry, they'll see it.

PICARD'S VOICE:
What about our warp signature? It has to be strong enough for them to detect.

GEORDI'S VOICE:
It'll be tight, but we should make it.

PICARD'S VOICE:
Are we on schedule? The Vulcan ship will be here in less than two hours.

PICARD:
I'm afraid you've caught me. I am a space-man.

SCRIMM:
And you know all this... because you're a space-man too...

PICARD:
From another planet. Oh, I almost forgot... they have green blood and pointed ears.

SCRIMM:
Wrong answer, Mister Picard. Try again.

PICARD:
There is no invasion...

SCRIMM:
These people you're calling "Vulcans"... who are they? Where do they come from? How many troops? What kind of weapons?

PICARD:
Invasion.

SCRIMM:
The invasion plans.

PICARD:
What do you want?

SCRIMM:
Not yet.

PICARD:
Something wrong with that?

SCRIMM:
You seem to have an answer for everything.

PICARD:
I think he was running a test on an old rocket engine... and one of the fuel cells burst.

SCRIMM:
Maybe you can tell me what he's been doing in that silo. We heard some explosions out there this morning...

PICARD:
Yes.

SCRIMM:
Lucky for him you came by when you did. He might be dead now.

PICARD:
I'm an old friend of Cochrane's... I wanted to see how he was doing.

SCRIMM:
And what were you doing out at the missile silo?

SCRIMM:
Huh.

PICARD:
It wasn't a trick. I used to be an electrical engineer.

SCRIMM:
That was a pretty clever trick you did with the hospital's batteries. How'd you do it?

PICARD:
There's a few of us left.

SCRIMM:
Beautiful city. Used to be, anyway. I didn't think anyone still lived there.

PICARD:
California. San Francisco.

SCRIMM:
Where are you from most recently?

SCRIMM:
Not really. I was born and raised right here. Never had much use for travel.

PICARD:
Oh... here and there. You know how it is.

SCRIMM:
Where in the States?

SCRIMM:
You don't sound French.

PICARD:
Yes.

SCRIMM:
Great name. French?

PICARD:
Jean-Luc Picard.

SCRIMM:
Lieutenant, actually. Lieutenant Jonathan Scrimm. I'm the head of the Resurrection Protective Force. And you are?

PICARD:
Oh... yes... ultraviolet protection. Thank you. Mister...?

RUBY:
You've been interfering with my life ever since I met you. Don't stop now.

PICARD:
This may be hard for you to understand... but I'm duty-bound not to interfere with you, or anyone else here... any more than is absolutely necessary.

RUBY:
Why?

PICARD:
That's impossible.

RUBY:
I don't care if you're from France or Venus... just take me with you.

PICARD:
No... I'm from France.

RUBY:
It's the future, isn't it? Just like you told Scrimm. I knew you weren't from around here.

PICARD:
No. It's a lot further than that.

RUBY:
Where? And don't tell me San Francisco...

PICARD:
I have to...

RUBY:
You're leaving, aren't you?

PICARD:
I am not a thief...

RUBY:
And all I'm asking for is the truth. That would take five minutes. For all I know, you caused the explosions at the silo... and now you're trying to steal Zephram's ship.

PICARD:
Why are you being so difficult? All I'm asking for is to look at one of the photographs. It'll take five minutes.

RUBY:
Or...?

PICARD:
We have to launch his ship by tomorrow afternoon.

RUBY:
All right. Truth. I believe that one. Why is it so urgent you couldn't wait until morning?

PICARD:
A key piece of the ship has been destroyed... and our only hope to reconstruct it is if one of your photographs shows us what it looked like.

RUBY:
Lie. That's one. Keep going.

PICARD:
Some.

RUBY:
Friends from Cornell...

PICARD:
Myself... and a few other friends of Zephram's.

RUBY:
We?

PICARD:
We're trying to repair Doctor Cochrane's ship. It's been damaged and --

RUBY:
Okay, let's hear it. I'm sure you have a great explanation for why those rocket photos are so important you broke into my house.

RUBY:
Don't flatter yourself. I take pictures of a lot of junk.

PICARD:
I'd say you already have.

RUBY:
Too bad. Besides, it'll give you all night to think up a new set of lies.

PICARD:
It can't wait until tomorrow...

RUBY:
I'm sure it is. But it'll have to wait until tomorrow.

PICARD:
Ruby... I need to talk to you about those photographs. It's very important.

PICARD:
How did you know about that?

RUBY:
No... not like you and Doctor Crusher used to be.

PICARD:
Were the two of you... involved?

PICARD:
Are you always sucha good judge of character?

RUBY:
You're not someone who lies very easily... so it's obvious when you do... at least to me.

PICARD:
What makes you say that?

RUBY:
You're lying.

PICARD:
What?

RUBY:
'Fraid not.

PICARD:
I'm an old friend... I met him when he was doing his undergraduate work at Cornell back in --

RUBY:
Trade. Okay. The photographs... for a straight answer. Who are you? And how do you know Zephram?

PICARD:
No... but sometimes I feel that way. What I meant was, I'd be willing to trade for the photographs.

RUBY:
You'd have to try real hard. No one's used currency in over ten years. What are you, from another planet?

PICARD:
I can try.

RUBY:
"Money." So you can get dome money...

PICARD:
Did you take any other pictures of the rocket?

RUBY:
Bed sheets. I used my last set of bed sheets to make those prints. Not the best material, but I haven't seen a clean piece of paper in five years.

PICARD:
Yes... I wanted to ask you about some photographs I saw out at the silo. There were three of them... printed on some kind of fabric.

RUBY:
Did you need something?

PICARD:
I'm very sorry.

RUBY:
Yes... and I only had enough silver halide for one shot. So you're lucky you didn't screw it up.

PICARD:
Cochrane?

RUBY:
Thank God this plate was already fixed.

PICARD:
Ah... yes... but, I didn't realize that --

RUBY:
What are you, an idiot? Didn't you see the red light was on?

PICARD:
Yes, he is.

RUBY:
Take care of him. He's a very special man.

TROI:
Western hemisphere... North American continent...

PICARD:
Track their weapons fire.

PICARD:
We have to follow them back... repair whatever damage they've done to that time-line.

TROI:
Captain...?

TROI:
Population... thirty-five billion... All Borg.

PICARD:
Life signs?

PICARD:
On screen.

TROI:
Incoming transmission from the Borg.

TROI:
Aye, sir.

PICARD:
Signal the Endeavor to fall back. We'll cover them.

PICARD:
Onscreen.

WORF:
Incoming transmission from Starfleet Command. Admiral Hayes.

WORF:
Aye, sir.

PICARD:
Worf, have Doctor Crusher, Mister La Forge and a security team meet me in Transporter Room Three. Civilian clothes.

PICARD:
Fire!

WORF:
Target locked!

PICARD:
Go to manual.

WORF:
Phasers are off-line... we have two quantum torpedoes left. But the computer targeting system has been destroyed.

PICARD:
Intercept course, full impulse. Weapons status?

WORF:
Captain, I've found the Borg Sphere. It's on the far side of the planet...firing at the surface.

PICARD:
Steady as she goes.

WORF:
Hull integrity down to thirty percent...

PICARD:
Data, set a course for that vortex.

WORF:
Captain, there are five Borg ships closing in on our position.

WORF:
Aye, sir.

PICARD:
Time travel... they're attempting time travel... Full power, Mister Data. Worf, quantum torpedoes at my command!

PICARD:
Fire.

WORF:
Port battery, ready sir!

RIKER:
No, sir.

PICARD:
Unless you'd like to stay.

RIKER:
Yes, sir. But Captain... are we... all going back?

PICARD:
Then make it so. Have you determined how to recreate the temporal vortex?

RIKER:
Yes, sir.

PICARD:
Return to our own time?

PICARD:
I'll keep in contact. You have the Bridge.

RIKER:
Good luck, sir.

PICARD:
Normally, I would agree. But in this case, the mission requires a certain knowledge of 21st century history. You're many things, Number One, but you're not much of an historian.

RIKER:
And if they succeed, humans won't make First Contact with the Vulcans tomorrow. As First Officer I should be the one beaming down...

PICARD:
In twenty-four hours, Zephram Cochrane is supposed to conduct the very first warp test... from a missile silo in Montana. If I'm right, the Borg were trying to change the course of human history by killing him or destroying his ship.

RIKER:
Captain?

RIKER:
Can't tell. Long-range bio- sensors are off-line.

PICARD:
Life signs?

RIKER:
Looks like they damaged the silo...

PICARD:
On screen.

RIKER:
We're still in Earth orbit.

PICARD:
Report.

RIKER:
They did it... they assimilated Earth.

PICARD:
They must've done it in the past... they went back and changed history...

PICARD:
Worf... torpedo... now!

RIKER:
We're caught in some kind of energy wake from the vortex...

WORF:
Nothing.

RIKER:
Emergency override!

WORF:
We've lost Bridge control!

RIKER:
Report!

WORF:
Understood!

RIKER:
Worf! I'm going to need at least five minutes!

RIKER:
I'll keep that in mind.

WORF:
And Commander, whatever you do... do not vomit in your exo-suit. It would be... unpleasant.

RIKER:
Right.

WORF:
Try not to look at the stars... keep your eyes on the ship.

RIKER:
Just a little queasy...

WORF:
Are you alright?

WORF:
The Borg will undoubtedly attack. Set phasers to rotating modulation.

RIKER:
I guess I'd better get it right the first time.

WORF:
You will have to realign the targeting array of the quantum torpedo... and reprogram the warhead for the localized detonation. There's only one torpedo left...

WORF:
Destroy the deflector dish.

RIKER:
Agreed. Options?

WORF:
We have to stop them from sending that message.

WORF:
They're converting the deflector dish into an antennae...

RIKER:
They're connecting the conduits to subspace communications...

RIKER:
Computer -- thermal enhancement.

WORF:
They're re-routing the deflector power conduits...

WORF:
They appear to be modifying the deflector dish.

RIKER:
What are they doing?

RIKER:
We have to cover both possibilities. We'll take care of the Bridge. Worf, take your men and seal off Main Engineering. Turn it into a fortress -- nothing gets in.

WORF:
To control the Enterprise, they'll have to gain access to one of two locations. Main Engineering... or the Bridge.

RIKER:
We'll have to assume they've been assimilated into the Collective.

WORF:
We saw at least thirty...and there are twenty-two Enterprise crewmembers reported missing... including Commander Data.

WORF:
It appears that someone has taken over the Environmental Control Room.

RIKER:
What the hell is happening, Worf?

RIKER:
What?

WORF:
A ship-wide decompression has been initiated!

RIKER:
Assign another team if you need to. I want to re-establish communication with the Captain as soon as possible.

WORF:
I have assigned two damage control teams to locate the source of our communication problems. So far, they've had no success.

WORF:
Incoming message from the Starship Intrepid. Admiral Hayes.

RIKER:
Casualties are light, Captain. Minor buckling on the port nacelle. Nothing serious.

RIKER:
Hold that thought.

TROI:
I have to admit there was a moment there when --

RIKER:
I think Mister Worf is suggesting that we go outside for a little stroll...

TROI:
What are you suggesting?

RIKER:
I remember it made me sick.

RIKER:
Deflector dish... why the deflector dish...?

TROI:
To do what? If they wanted a weapon, they could've taken over a phaser bank or torpedo bay...

RIKER:
Where the hell are they going?

TROI:
They're bypassing Engineering...

TROI:
Do we have any idea how many Borg we're dealing with?

RIKER:
All right... we've lost control of eight decks... three Cargo Bays... one Shuttlebay.

RIKER:
Mister Worf... find Data if you can, but your top priority is isolating the Borg.

TROI:
Wil... Data was down there.

RIKER:
The Borg. Some of them must've beamed over before we destroyed their ship. Seal off that entire deck with emergency force fields.

TROI:
Someone...?

TROI:
We just lost main power... and we've got Class-Three alerts all over the ship. I'm not sure what's --

RIKER:
Report.

WORF:
Commander... we have a problem.

RIKER'S COM VOICE:
What the hell happened down there, Worf?

WORF:
Something is very wrong, Commander. We're falling back.

RIKER'S COM VOICE:
Worf? Is something wrong?

RIKER'S COM VOICE:
Any sign of Data, or the Borg themselves?

WORF:
Worf to Bridge. We're about to enter the Environmental Control Room.

WORF:
There's a dampening field in place on this deck. Our tricorders are useless.

RIKER'S COM VOICE:
Riker here.

WORF:
Worf to Bridge.

WORF:
What kind of message?

TROI:
They may be trying to send a message to the other Borg...the Borg in this time period...

WORF:
Data's positronic net contains classified information on the Enterprise. Command codes, security protocols...

TROI:
Even Data?

WORF:
There were no planetary defense systems in this era. Their weapons were designed to fight each other... not extraterrestrials.

TROI:
Are we in any danger of being detected by Earth defense systems?

WORF:
Target...

TROI:
Captain, they're firing at a nuclear missile silo... in central Montana.

TROI:
Captain, I've scanned the planet. The atmosphere contains a high concentration of methane, carbon monoxide and fluorine. The oceans have been chemically altered, as well.

WORF:
No response. I'm not reading any Starfleet com traffic in this entire sector.

B-9:
How long is that?

DATA:
Indefinitely.

B-9:
For how long?

DATA:
No. I must deactivate you.

B-9:
No. Can I move now?

DATA:
Do you have any knowledge of the tactical abi1ities of this ship?

B-9:
No.

DATA:
Do you know anything about Shinzon's plans against the Federation?

DATA:
I know.

B-9:
I do not understand.

DATA:
You have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship.

B-9:
Why?

DATA:
Because you are dangerous.

B-9:
Why?

DATA:
No, I have only activated your cognitive and communication subroutines.

B-9:
Brother. I cannot move.

DATA:
Is that your final answer?

B-9:
No.

DATA:
Do you know the name of the Captain of this vessel?

B-9:
No.

DATA:
Can you remember our father?

B-9:
I am in a room with lights.

DATA:
Do you know where you are?

DATA:
No. My name is Data... I am your brother.

B-9:
You are me.

DATA:
Do you know who I am?

DATA:
Yes, please continue.

B-9:
Fuzzy face is gone.

B-9:
I was taken from my homeworld by people called the "PakJeds." They are fat. They traded me to a ship belonging to the "Bolians." The "Bolians" are blue. They put me in a seat and asked me questions. Then they were attacked by another ship...

DATA:
Can you tell me how you came to be on the planet where we found you?

PICARD:
Not tonight, I have work here.

BEVERLY:
They're running me ragged. Nothing but question day and night... I love it! Come to dinner and 1'1 tell you all about it. There's a Bajoran band at the officer's mess.

PICARD:
Reminds me of a young doctor I used to know...

BEVERLY:
You can' t imagine them, Jean Luc. They're kids! All with advance degrees in xenobiology and out to conquer every disease in the quadrant.

PICARD:
How far we've come. Let me know if you need anything.

BEVERLY:
That was another time.

PICARD:
I'm counting on it... We've been ordered to head to sector 3274. Starfleet is diverting the fleet to meet us there.

BEVERLY:
But we do have one advantage. He needs your blood to live. He might come after you first.

BEVERLY:
I can't be sure but the rate of decay seems to be accelerating.

PICARD:
How long does he have?

PICARD:
Dying?

BEVERLY:
As a result the temporal sequencing was never activated. Remember, he was supposed to replace you at nearly your current age. He was engineered to skip thirty years of life. But since the RNA sequencing was never activated, his cellular structure has started to break down. He's dying.

PICARD:
But the Romulans abandoned the plan.

BEVERLY:
The more I studied his DNA the more confusing it got. Finally I could only come to one conclusion... Shinzon was created with temporal RNA sequencing. He was designed so that at a certain point his aging process could be accelerated to reach your age more quickly, so he could replace you.

PICARD:
Can you describe it, Deanna?

BEVERLY:
Aside from slightly elevated adrenalin and serotonin levels, you're completely normal.

PICARD:
I wish I could believe that, Doctor.

BEVERLY:
Jean Luc, Whatever you were... Right now you're the man you've made yourself. He's someone else.

PICARD:
Yes.

BEVERLY:
Is he very much like you were?

PICARD:
I so wanted to believe Shinzon. But the Thalaron radiation can't be explained away. Whatever he's after, it's not peace.

BEVERLY:
He turned out all right.

PICARD:
He was a damn fool. Selfish and ambitious. Very much in need of seasoning.

BEVERLY:
He was a bit proud as I recall.

PICARD:
Remember him?

BEVERLY:
You're working late.

PICARD:
Beverly, come in.

PICARD:
Understood. Keep on it. I need to know what he has and how to neutralize any threat. Give me options.

BEVERLY:
It has the ability to consume organic material at the subatomic level. I can't overestimate the danger of Thalaron radiation, Jean Luc. A microscopic amount could kill every living thing on this ship in a matter of seconds.

BEVERLY:
About twenty-five years ago. They probably used a hair follicle or skin cell.

PICARD:
When was he... created?

PICARD:
Please, Beverly, this is hard enough.

BEVERLY:
Sort of like losing a son and gaining an empath, isn't it?

BEVERLY:
It'll serve you right.

DATA:
Sir.

PICARD:
Negative.

DATA:
Sir, allow me to go. You are needed here.

PICARD:
Deanna, stand by. Open a channel.

DATA:
We are being hailed.

PICARD:
Divert power and compensate.

DATA:
Captain, we have lost ventral shielding on deck twenty nine.

PICARD:
Full axis rotation to port! Fire all ventral phasers!

DATA:
We are losing dorsal shields.

PICARD:
Commander Riker, evasive maneuvers!

DATA:
Yes, sir. The Rift effects all long-range communications.

PICARD:
It's interfering with our uplink from Starfleet cartography?

DATA:
We are passing through the Bassen Rift. The projections will return when we have cleared it.

DATA:
I aspire, sir. To be better than I am. The B-9 does not. Nor does Shinzon.

PICARD:
How can you be sure?

DATA:
No, sir, it is not possible. The B-9 is physically identical to me, although his neural pathways are not as advanced. But even if they were, he would not be me.

PICARD:
He may have already rejected my humanity, but you also have a twin

DATA:
He would deny a "human" connection is possible. He considers himself entirely Reman.

PICARD:
But so much is the same. On a biological level he is... and I will not accept the idea that there is nothing I can do. I have a responsibility to try to make a human connection with him.

DATA:
I do not agree. Although you share the same genetic structure, the events of your life have created unique individual.

PICARD:
Yes.

DATA:
Of you?

PICARD:
"For now we see but through a glass darkly..." He said he's a mirror.

DATA:
At our current velocity we will arrive at sector 3274 in approximately 40 minutes.

PICARD:
How long until we reach the fleet?

PICARD:
Fire!

DATA:
Ready, Captain.

PICARD:
We're about to find out... Power up disruptors and fire on my mark.

DATA:
Do you think this is a wise course of action?

PICARD:
Well then... only one way to go.

DATA:
Affirmative, sir. Negative, sir. They have instigated security overrides and erected a force field around the external portals.

PICARD:
Can you open the shuttlebay doors?

DATA:
Port thrusters, sir. Would you like me to drive?

PICARD:
What do you imagine this is?

PICARD:
While I find that fascinating, Data, we really need that Goddamned door open!

DATA:
They are trying to override the access codes. Reman is really a most complex language with pictographs representing certain verb roots and...

PICARD:
Alacrity would be appreciated, Commander.

DATA:
There is a shuttlebay 948 meters from our current location.

PICARD:
We'll find a way off together. Recommendations?

DATA:
Yes, sir.

PICARD:
It'll only work for one of us.

DATA:
Geordi equipped me with the prototype for the Emergency Transport Unit. I recommend you use it to return to the Enterprise.

DATA:
It would appear so.

PICARD:
A weapon.

DATA:
Aye, sir... This way.

PICARD:
A bit less florid, Data.

DATA:
He believes he has our communications protocols. But they will give him inaccurate locations for all Starfleet vessels.

PICARD:
Good work. The download?

DATA:
My mission was a success, sir. I have discovered the source of the Thalaron radiation.

PICARD:
On my way.

DATA:
Data to Captain Picard. Geordi and I have identified the source of the unauthorized computer access. And, I believe, we have also discovered an opportunity to gain a tactical advantage.

PICARD:
Well... it seems we're truly sailing into the unknown. Keep at it. Anything you can give me would be appreciated. Dismissed.

DATA:
Starfleet intelligence was only able to provide a partial account of his military record. We can infer he is relatively young and a capablecommander. He fought seventeen major engagements in the war. All successful. Beyond that, we know nothing.

DATA:
Sorry, sir.

PICARD:
Data!

PICARD:
I can see that.

DATA:
He is very observant.

PICARD:
Mister Worf, accompany Data please.

DATA:
The final signature is approx- imately 300 meters up that incline.

PICARD:
Thank you, Data. Let's see what she can do.

DATA:
The closest signature is two kilometers to the west... that direction, sir.

PICARD:
New worlds. Yes Data, brave new worlds...

DATA:
To new worlds...

PICARD:
Now, you make a toast.

DATA:
If I were... I believe my memory engrams would sense the absence of your specific reactions and behavior. I would "miss you."

PICARD:
You never know what's over the horizon, Data. Before too long you'll be offered a command of your own.

DATA:
The choices I made have led me here as well. This is the only home I have ever known. I cannot foresee a reason for leaving.

PICARD:
Yes. And, frankly, I envy them as well. They've made important choices; they're going to have great challenges ahead of them. New worlds to conquer...

DATA:
That is because you have a familiarity with them. You can predict specific reactions and behavior and are comfortable in that knowledge.

PICARD:
Well. I suppose it does a bit. I'm very happy for them, of course, but I'm going to miss them. The ship will seem... incomplete without them.

DATA:
And this makes you "sad"?

PICARD:
Will and Deanna joining the Titan. Dr. Crusher going to Starfleet Medical...

DATA:
And you were particularly aware of this feeling because Commander Riker will be leaving to assume command of the Titan?

PICARD:
I understand why it would seem confusing. Certain human rituals... like weddings, birthdays or funerals evoke strong and very complex emotions. These rites carry great weight with us because they denote the passage of time.

DATA:
Sir. I noticed an interesting confluence of emotion at the wedding. I am familiar with the human concept of tears through laughter and its inverse, laughter through tears, but I could not help wondering about the human capacity for expressing both pleasure and sadness simultaneously.

DATA:
To happy endings.

PICARD:
So... To happy endings.

HEAD:
Why?

DATA:
Because the captain has to concentrate on piloting the vehicle.

HEAD:
Why?

DATA:
This is not an appropriate time for a conversation.

HEAD:
You have a red shirt.

HEAD:
You do not look like me.

DATA:
You are not looking at your- self. You are looking at me.

HEAD:
Why am I looking at me?

DATA:
What is our approximate distance?

GEORDI:
Emergency force fields are holding.

DATA:
We have lost structural integrity on decks twelve through seventeen, sections four through ten.

DATA:
I am not.

GEORDI:
Don't give up hope, Data. I know, I know, you're not capable of hope.

DATA:
But I believe he will prove incapable of performing higher functions.

DATA:
No, I do not mind.

GEORDI:
It's possible the extra memory port is interfering with the engram processing. Mind if I keep him here and run some diagnostics?

DATA:
Dr. Soong must have found it unnecessary in later versions.

GEORDI:
It seems to be a redundant memory port. Maybe it's for provisional memory storage in case his neural pathways overload?

DATA:
What purpose does this serve?

GEORDI:
Maybe he's not supposed to be like you. Maybe he's supposed to be just like he is.

DATA:
Yes.

GEORDI:
An individual more like you, you mean.

DATA:
I feel nothing, Geordi. It is my belief that with my memory engrams he will be able to function as a more complete individual.

GEORDI:
He'd have all your memories too. You feel comfortable with that?

DATA:
Captain Picard agrees that the B-9 was probably designed with the same self-actualization parameters as myself. If my memory engrams are successfully integrated into his positronic matrix, he should have all my abilities.

GEORDI:
I can't believe the Captain went along with a memory download.

DATA:
At present he serves no useful function. Dr. Soong created us to become active and useful members of society. I do not believe he would have wanted the B-9 to live out his life in his present state.

DATA:
Do you have a name, sir?

GEORDI:
Captain, I don't recommend transporting, that ion storm doesn't look very neighborly. -It could head this way without much warning.

DATA:
Isolated pockets of humanoids. It appears to be a pre-warp civilization at an early stage of industrial development.

DATA:
I thought only me, myself and Lore.

GEORDI:
How many of you did Dr. Soong make?

DATA:
Since positronic signatures have only been known to emanate from androids such as myself, it is logical to theorize that there is an android such as myself on Kolarus III.

DATA:
Thank you.

WORF:
If you wouldn't mind.

DATA:
I would like to pick you up now. May I do that?

WORF:
No.

DATA:
The resemblance is... striking.

WORF:
It's you.

DATA:
Like me, it has been designed with modular power sources.

WORF:
Why is it moving?

DATA:
It appears to be... an arm.

PICARD:
This isn't about me anymore.

DEANNA:
But how can he? He'll kill you.

PICARD:
Make it so.

DEANNA:
The one thing he may have forgotten in the course of battle: me.

PICARD:
Counselor?

DEANNA:
Captain -- I might have a way to find them.

PICARD:
I know how he thinks.

DEANNA:
How can you be certain?

PICARD:
Permission denied. If you can possibly endure any more of these assaults. I need you at my side. Now more than ever I...

DEANNA:
Shinzon's Viceroy seems to have the ability to reach into my thoughts. I've become a liability... I request to be relieved of my duties.

PICARD:
I not only know him, Deanna, I am him.. and he is me!

DEANNA:
Captain, don't assume he's anything like you are. You should resist the urge to think you know him.

PICARD:
How could I not?

DEANNA:
Sir, the strongest sense I had was that he's more than urious about you. He very much wants to know you. The same way you want to know him.

DEANNA:
I don't know.

PICARD:
Is he sincere about wanting peace?

DEANNA:
I would say he's been trained to resist telepathy. What I could sense of his emotions were erratic, very hard to follow.

DEANNA:
And I you.

PICARD:
I'm going to miss you.

PICARD:
As much as we care for him, Deanna... we have to remember that Data isn't capable of disappointment.

DEANNA:
The B-9 is like a slow child, sir. And Data, in his own way, has assumed the position of a parent or guardian. I'm afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences. He'll be disappointed when the BI-9 cannot meet those expectations.

PICARD:
You're speaking of emotional investment?

DEANNA:
It's about Data I've watched him with the B-9 and I'm troubled. Data's desire for a "family" is very strong. I'm afraid he may be investing too much in the B-9.

PICARD:
Of course, sit down.

DEANNA:
Do you have a moment, sir?

PICARD:
Counselor.

DEANNA:
With pleasure, Captain.

PICARD:
May I have this dance?

PICARD:
The hell you will. You know too much about me as it is... Now you promised there are no speeches during the ceremony on Betazed.

DEANNA:
And you needn't worry. I'll brief your new counselor on everything she needs to know.

DEANNA:
Really, Captain, it was a lovely toast.

SHINZON:
I can feel your desire, Deanna.

DEANNA:
No.

SHINZON:
Very logical, Deanna... But your heart doesn't constrain itself to mere logic. To leave all of this behind and be with me.

DEANNA:
You're not here.

DEANNA:
You sick bastard!

SHINZON:
I'll always be with you now. Now and forever.

SHINZON:
Can you feel my hands... are they real? Can you feel my lips, my loins?

DEANNA:
This isn't real.

SHINZON:
He can never know you as I know you... He can never touch you as I touch you.

DEANNA:
No!

SHINZON:
Imzadi. This is so good.

SHINZON:
Deanna Troi of Betazed. Empathic and telepathic abilities, ship's counselor. All of this I knew... But I didn't know you were so beautiful.

DEANNA:
I'm only half human.

PICARD:
Thank you, Commander.

DONATRA:
This is Commander Donatra of the Valdore. We're dispatching shuttles with medical personnel and supplies.

PICARD:
Open a channel.

PICARD:
Understood.

PICARD:
Do you have life support?

DONATRA:
I'm afraid that drink will have to wait, Captain.

PICARD:
When this is over, I owe you a drink.

DONATRA:
The Empire considers this a matter of internal security. We regret you've become involved.

PICARD:
Your timing is impeccable, Commander.

DONATRA:
Captain Picard, Commander Donatra of the Warbird Valdore. Might we be of assistance?

PICARD:
Number One. You have the bridge.

GEORDI:
I'll take care of it, sir.

PICARD:
Geordi... prepare the shuttle- bay for arrivals. They don't know our procedures so just... open the doors.

PICARD:
On screen.

GEORDI:
Sir, we're being hailed.

GEORDI:
Aye, sir.

PICARD:
You have the bridge, Commander. Use all available power to move away from the Scimitar. Now, Mister La Forge.

PICARD:
That's an order, Commander.

PICARD:
Prepare for a site-to-site transport.

GEORDI:
The targeting sequence should take about four minutes.

PICARD:
How long until he can fire?

GEORDI:
Ready, sir!

PICARD:
Deanna, on my mark.

GEORDI:
Aye, sir.

PICARD:
Geordi, put 211 power to the engines. Take it from life support if you have to -- everything you can give me.

GEORDI:
Sir?

PICARD:
He thinks he knows exactly what I'm going to do.

PICARD:
He wants to look me in the eye.

GEORDI:
What's he doing?

PICARD:
What if we target all phasers in a concentrated attack?

GEORDI:
He's getting his cloak back. We have exhausted our compliment of photon torpedoes. Phaser banks are down to four percent.

PICARD:
And that's exactly what he's going to do.

GEORDI:
It's called a Cascading Bio- genic Pulse. The unique properties of Thalaron radiation allow the energy beam to expand almost without limits. Depending on the radiant intensity it could encompass a ship... or a planet.

PICARD:
As I remember, Thalaron research was banned in the Federation because of its bioqenic properties.

GEORDI:
Which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up. But he's got it, Captain.

PICARD:
I thought Thalaron radiation was theoretical.

GEORDI:
There's something else. I was reviewing the sensor logs.

PICARD:
Set up a security program to detect any unusual data stream rerouting. If it happens again, we want to be ready.

GEORDI:
That's what I don't get -- it's mostly basic stellar cartography: star charts; communications protocols; some uplinks from colony tracking stations. It's not even restricted material.

PICARD:
What programs were accessed?

GEORDI:
It's going to take some time to find out -- the data stream was rerouted through substations all over the ship.

GEORDI:
Then how did a Reman get to be Praetor? I don't get it.

PICARD:
Cannon fodder.

PICARD:
What do we know about the population?

GEORDI:
I read six distinct positronic signatures, spread out over a few kilometers on the surface.

PICARD:
Theories?

GEORDI:
Uncharted. We'll have to get closer for a more detailed scan.

PICARD:
What do we know about the planet?

GEORDI:
It's very faint but I've isolated it to the third planet in the Kolarin system.

JANEWAY:
Let's hope that luck holds. Janeway out.

PICARD:
Just lucky, Admiral.

PICARD:
Not with the Romulans.

PICARD:
Understood.

JANEWAY:
 Believe me, we don't under- stand it either. You're the closest ship so I want you to high tail it over there and hear what he has to say. Get the lay of the land, If the Empire becomes unstable, it could mean trouble for the entire quadrant.

JANEWAY:
There's more... as always. He's Reman.

PICARD:
New Praetor?

JANEWAY:
A diplomatic mission. We've been invited, believe it or not. Seems there's been some kind of internal political shakeup. The new Praetor, someone called Shinzon, has requested a Federation envoy.

PICARD:
With or without the rest of the fleet?

PICARD:
Admiral Janeway. Good to see you.

VICEROY:
I look forward to the sport. Take him.

PICARD:
There'll be another after me. And another after that. You'll find we're a resilient species.

VICEROY:
It would take me but an instant to tear that valiant heart from your chest.

VICEROY:
Listen to him, android. Such a small and weak creature. Yet he roars so valiantly...

PICARD:
That will never happen.

VICEROY:
I'm preparing her for Shinzon. To sooth him as she soothes you. To stand at his side as she does at yours.

PICARD:
What are you doing to Counsellor Troi?

VICEROY:
So, human... you've met your better self!

VICEROY:
I am not Shinzon. I am his Viceroy. We are sending transport coordinates.

PICARD:
Praetor Shinzon, I'm pleased to...

VICEROY:
Enterprise. We are the Reman Warbird Scimitar.

WORF:
Your new chair, sir.

PICARD:
What's this?

PICARD:
On my way. Please notify Commander Riker.

WORF:
Captain, the Hemingway has arrived to tow us to spacedock.

WORF:
Aye, sir.

PICARD:
Coordinate our attack with the Valdore's tactical officer. Triangulate fire on any shield impacts.

PICARD:
On screen.

WORF:
Sir, we're being hailed.

WORF:
Aye, sir

PICARD:
Worf, prepare a full phaser spread, zero elevation. All banks on my mark. Scan for shield impacts and stand by photon torpedoes.

PICARD:
Who was it?

WORF:
Sir, we've had an unauthorized access into the main computer.

PICARD:
On screen.

WORF:
We're being hailed.

WORF:
Fifty-two disruptor banks, twenty-seven photon torpedo bays, primary and secondary phased shields.

PICARD:
Tactical analysis, Mister Worf.

WORF:
Captain!

PICARD:
No!

PICARD:
Not yet, Mister Worf.

WORF:
Sir, I recommend we raise shields.

PICARD:
If you don't mind.

WORF:
To find the head, sir?

PICARD:
What sort of signature?

WORF:
I'm picking up an unusual electromagnetic signature from the Kolarin system.

PICARD:
Come now, a big, strapping fellow like you? What are you afraid of?

WORF:
Captain. I think it is inappropriate for a Starfleet officer to appear... Naked.

WORF:
I won't do it.

PICARD:
The honor was mine. Captain Riker.

RIKER:
Serving with you has been an honor.

RIKER:
I intend to.

PICARD:
When your first officer insists that you can't go on away missions... Ignore him.

RIKER:
Anything.

PICARD:
I promise you in time, she'll become your home... If I could offer you one piece of advice?

RIKER:
But she's not the Enterprise.

PICARD:
The Titan's a fine ship, will. And she's getting a captain worthy of her.

PICARD:
Agreed.

RIKER:
Unless we can disable his cloak we're just going to be firing in the dark.

PICARD:
Counselor Troi, report to the bridge.

RIKER:
He's firing through his cloak. We can't get a lock.

PICARD:
Report.

PICARD:
We can only hope so.

RIKER:
Strength in numbers?

PICARD:
And the Romulans invade.

RIKER:
Oh boy. Destroy humanity and the Federation is crippled.

PICARD:
His hatred of the Federation is apparent. He would have built a weapon of that scope for one reason. He is going after Earth.

RIKER:
Sir?

PICARD:
Can anything be done for him?

RIKER:
He wasn't designed to live a complete, human life span.

PICARD:
Away team. Transporter room four.

RIKER:
Not very chatty.

PICARD:
She's a predator.

RIKER:
She's not out for a pleasure cruise.

PICARD:
Patience. Diplomacy is a very exacting occupation. We can wait.

RIKER:
Captain, with all due respect to diplomatic protocols -- the Federation Council's not sitting out here, we are.

PICARD:
Counselor?

RIKER:
It's working.

PICARD:
It's an old psychological strategy, Number One. To put him in a position of dominance and make us uneasy.

RIKER:
Why don't they answer our hails?

RIKER:
The Praetor's power has always been the Romulan fleet. They must be behind him.

PICARD:
A coup d'etat?

RIKER:
We have to assume he had Romulan collaborators.

PICARD:
Acknowledged... I'll talk to Data.

RIKER:
Captain, you have an Alpha Priority communication from Starfleet Command.

PICARD:
Captain's prerogative, Will. There's no foreseeable danger... and your wife would never forgive me if anything happened to you.

RIKER:
Sir --

PICARD:
I appreciate your concern, Number One, but I've been itching to try out the Argo.

RIKER:
Captain, I hope I don't have to remind you --

RIKER:
Thank you, sir...

PICARD:
I think it's worth a look. Don't worry, Number One, we'll get you to Betazed with time to spare.

PICARD:
Still well on our side...

RIKER:
Diverting to the Kolarin system takes us awfully close to the Romulan Neutral Zone.

SHINZON:
Don't you think it's time to surrender? I'll have my cloak back in a matter of minutes and your poor ship is shot to pieces. Why should the rest of your crew have to die?

PICARD:
I am.

SHINZON:
I hope you're still alive, Jean Luc.

SHINZON:
I have no choices! I can't fight what I am!

PICARD:
You can still make a choice! Make the right one now!

PICARD:
Please.

SHINZON:
That's your life... not mine.

PICARD:
But you want to.

SHINZON:
I don't know.

PICARD:
So if I gave you my life, what would you do with it? Would you spend the years in a blaze of hatred as you are now? Or could you change? Could you try to remember a mother's touch you never felt? A father's words you never heard? Could you do that?

SHINZON:
Yes.

SHINZON:
He is what his life has made him!

PICARD:
The man who is Jean Luc Picard and Shinzon of Remus won't exterminate the population of an entire planet! He is better than that!

PICARD:
I see more than what you are.

SHINZON:
Childish dreams, Captain. Lost in the dilithium mines of Remus. I'm what you see now.

PICARD:
Not so long.

SHINZON:
Long ago.

PICARD:
I know you as well as I know myself, Shinzon. There was a time you looked at the stars and dreamed of what might be.

PICARD:
Look at me, Shinzon! Do you feel the blood pumping inside you? Your hands, your eyes, your nature, are the same as mine. Buried deep inside you beneath the years of pain and anger is a capacity you've forgotten. It's the one way our mirror can reflect the two of us exactly because it's the very thing that truly defines us. To be human is to try to make yourself better than you are.

SHINZON:
I know... you'll all gladly die to save your home world.

PICARD:
You know that's not possible.

SHINZON:
I have little interest in your quaint vessel, Captain. If the Enterprise will withdraw to a distance of one hundred light years, it will not be harmed.

PICARD:
And what of the Enterprise?

SHINZON:
To accept your surrender. I can clearly destroy you at any time. Lower your shields and allow me to transport you to my ship.

PICARD:
Why are you here?

SHINZON:
It's just the two of us now, Jean Luc, as it should be... Your ship and mine... You and me.

PICARD:
We are.

SHINZON:
You can't trace my holographic emitters, Captainn. So don't bother. And you can't contact Starfleet. We're quite alone.

SHINZON:
I think the facts speak for themselves. The same noble Picard blood runs in our veins. Had you lived my life, you'd be doing exactly as I am. Look in the mirror, and see yourself.

PICARD:
I'm incapable of such an act, and so are you.

SHINZON:
It amazes me how little you know yourself.

PICARD:
Think about what you're doing, Shinzon. Are you ready to plunge the entire quadrant into war to satisfy your own personal demons?

SHINZON:
Oh, but it does. We will no longer bow like slaves before anyone. Not the Romulans and not your mighty Federation. We're a race bred for war. For conquest.

PICARD:
If your issues are with me... This has nothing to do with my ship and nothing to do with the Federation.

SHINZON:
My life is meaningless as long as you're alive. What am I while you exist? A shadow? An enigma?

PICARD:
I won't defend my life to you.

SHINZON:
I see an old man, set in his ways, afraid to live without a uniform to prop him up and a Starfleet regulation to tell him what to do. I see the man I will never be.

PICARD:
I see a young man trying desperately to deny who he is.

SHINZON:
And I'm not quite human. So what am I? What do you see? Do you see a life you might have led? Lost youth never to be recaptured?

PICARD:
You're not Reman.

SHINZON:
It's about destiny, Picard. About a Reman outcast who...

PICARD:
What's this all about?

SHINZON:
Don't be so vain. After we found it, we made a few modifications. An extra memory port, a hidden transponder. Perhaps your eyes will be a bit less confident when you learn I've gained access to Starfleet's communications protocols. I now know the location of your entire fleet... You may go.

PICARD:
All of this so you could capture me?

SHINZON:
I need a sample of your blood. What do your Borg friends say? Resistance is futile.

PICARD:
What are you doing?

SHINZON:
I was lonely...

PICARD:
Why am I here?

SHINZON:
Hello, Jean Luc.

PICARD:
In time.

SHINZON:
In time, Jean Luc.

SHINZON:
I'm honored to think I might someday speak with such eloquence.

PICARD:
If there's one ideal the Federation holds most dear it's that all men, all races, can be united. From the first time the Vulcans came to Earth we've sought a future of peace. Nothing would make me more proud than to take your hand in friend- ship. In time. When trust has been earned.

SHINZON:
I know.

PICARD:
Shinzon... I'm trying to believe you.

SHINZON:
There is that.

PICARD:
With a full head of hair.

SHINZON:
I always hoped I would hit two meters.

PICARD:
So I'm not as tall as you expected?

SHINZON:
Age before rank, Jean Luc.

PICARD:
After you, Praetor.

PICARD:
New worlds.

SHINZON:
And you dreamed about what was up there. About...

PICARD:
Yes.

SHINZON:
Looking up at the stars.

PICARD:
No. I was the first Picard to leave Earth. It caused quite a stir, In fact. But I had spent my whole life...

SHINZON:
Were we always explorers?

PICARD:
There's so much, and so much of it is dull...

SHINZON:
I want to know where I come from. The Remans gave me a future. You can tell me about my past.

SHINZON:
All I have is my personal feelings. I wasn't raised with the ideals of the Federation. But I'm trying to understand them now. To live up to them. To live up to you.

PICARD:
And if you had lived my life you would understand that there is a great respons- ibility in representing the Federation. I can't let my personal feelings unduly influence my decisions.

PICARD:
I have no reason to.

SHINZON:
You don't trust me.

SHINZON:
No race should be a slave to another.

PICARD:
You're doing this to liberate the Remans?

SHINZON:
For thousands of years the Romulan Senate has met in this chamber and dictated the fate of its sister-planet... But the time has come for us to live as equals.

SHINZON:
They sent me there to die. How could a mere human survive the dilithium mines? It was... I was a slave. And a monster. The only thing the Romulan guards hated more than the Remans was me. But one man took pity on me: the man who became my Viceroy. He taught me how to survive. And in that dark place, where there was nothing of myself, I found my Reman brothers. They showed me the only kindness I ever knew.

PICARD:
How did you end up on Remus?

SHINZON:
Our eyes reflect our lives, don't they? Yours are so confident.

PICARD:
Yes. The eyes have it.

SHINZON:
A lifetime of violence will do that. My nose was broken four times. And my jaw... But so much is the same. The eyes, you recognize the eyes.

PICARD:
Not quite. I envy the hair- line.

SHINZON:
It's not quite the face you remember.

PICARD:
You'll acquire a taste for it.

SHINZON:
Romulan ale -- I'm surprised. I can't stand it.

SHINZON:
As happens so frequently here on Romulus, a new government came to power. They decided to abandon the plan -- frankly, I think they were afraid I'd be discovered and it would lead to war. They weren't ready for that.

PICARD:
What happened?

SHINZON:
And when I was ready they were going to replace you with me, an exact biological duplicate. Put a Romulan agent at the heart of Starfleet to.influence your command structure. It was a bold plan.

SHINZON:
I know.

PICARD:
You know I need to verify this.

SHINZON:
Come to dinner on Romulus tomorrow. Just the two of us. Or just the one of us.

PICARD:
We need to talk, just you and I.

PICARD:
You know I do.

SHINZON:
No one knew what to do. Finally I was taken to a doctor who had some experience with Terran illnesses and I was finally diagnosed with Shalaft's syndrome. Do you know of it, Captain?

SHINZON:
Then perhaps the time has come to add some illumination to our discussion. Computer, raise lighting four levels.

PICARD:
Yes.

SHINZON:
But you're also thinking the chance for peace is too promising to ignore. Above allyou're trying to decide if you can trust me.

SHINZON:
And you're wondering why the Scimitar is so well armed. Is this the ship of a peacemaker? Or a predator?.

PICARD:
Yes.

SHINZON:
I have dissolved the Senate.

PICARD:
And the Senate supports you?

SHINZON:
I want to end the centuries of mistrust. I want to be your ally, not your enemy. As a first step I propose we eliminate the Neutral Zone and begin a free and open exchange of goods and ideas.

SHINZON:
Unity, Captain! Tearing down the walls between us to recognize we are one people. Federation and Romulan. Human and Vulcan and Klingon and Reman. I'm speaking of the thing that makes us the same. We want peace.

PICARD:
I would be interested to know what we are talking about.

SHINZON:
Yes, I'm sorry, Captain. There's so much we have to talk about.

SHINZON:
On the world I come from there's no light. No sun. Beauty isn't important. I see now there's a world elsewhere.

PICARD:
Praetor, we've come to Romulus on a matter we were -- assured was of great importance. If you have anything to say to us as representatives of the Federation, I suggest you do so now.

SHINZON:
I am, Commander Riker... May I touch your hair?

SHINZON:
I've never met a human woman.

PICARD:
Praetor?

SHINZON:
No?

PICARD:
And you're not as we imagined you.

PICARD:
Praetor Shinzon?

SHINZON:
I hope you'll forgive the darkness... we're not comfortable in the light.

REMAN OFFICER:
But, Praetor, you won't survive without him...

SHINZON:
Our greater goal is more important, brother.

REMAN OFFICER:
What about Picard?

SHINZON:
Deploy the weapon. Kill everything on that ship. Then set a course for Earth.

REMAN OFFICER:
Disruptors are off-line, sir.

SHINZON:
Target disruptors. Destroy them.

REMAN OFFICER:
Two ships decloaking, sir! Romulan!

SHINZON:
Report!

SHINZON:
On my way.

REMAN OFFICER:
Praetor, we've received the transponder signal.

RIKER:
Let's go.

WORF:
Intruder alert!

WORF:
We're being hailed.

RIKER:
Believe it or not, I think the cavalry has arrived.

RIKER:
Defensive pattern Kirk Epsilon. Geordi, get those shields online.

WORF:
Minimal damage to the Scimitar.

WORF:
Should I raise shields?

RIKER:
My God...

RIKER:
Runs in the family.

WORF:
He's a very unusual android.

WORF:
It is... invigorating.

RIKER:
Well, that sounds relaxing too.

VICEROY:
She is here.

SHINZON:
What is it?!! Focus on your job!!

SHINZON:
FULL STOP AND FIRE !

VICEROY:
Praetor...

SHINZON:
You heard me.

VICEROY:
What?!

SHINZON:
Let her pursue -- drop cloak on the aft port quadrant and prepare for full emergency stop.

VICEROY:
Seven minutes.

SHINZON:
How long until we reach the Rift?

VICEROY:
A matter of hours now.

SHINZON:
How long?

SHINZON:
Have the doctors prepare. I'll be on the bridge.'

VICEROY:
It's accelerating. You have no more time for games.

SHINZON:
Do as I tell you!

VICEROY:
No -- this is wasting time.

SHINZON:
Find her again.

VICEROY:
The bond is broken.

SHINZON:
My time. I'll spend it how I choose.

VICEROY:
Don't forget our mission, Shinzon. We should act. Now. Time is running out.

SHINZON:
He's gentler than I thought. And he has a sense of humor.

VICEROY:
This is a mistake.

VICEROY:
Yes, Praetor.

SHINZON:
Are we prepared?

SHINZON:
And when I return... you and I shall have a little talk about showing proper respect!

SURAN:
For the moment.

SHINZON:
Commander Suran, the games are over. In two days the Federation will be crippled beyond repair. Does that satisfy you?

SURAN:
And mine is wearing thin, young man! We supported you because you promised action. And yet you delay and you waste your time playing games with Picard while--

SHINZON:
I thought we discussed patience, Commander.

SHINZON:
The Enterprise is immaterial! They won't make it back to Federation space.

SHINZON:
Now go. I have some personal business.

SURAN:
Praetor.

SHINZON:
Silence, Romulan!

SURAN:
Then perhaps you will enlight- en us?

SHINZON:
I have a purpose.

SURAN:
And bringing the Enterprise here?! What possible purpose could that serve?

SHINZON:
You don't have to understand.

SURAN:
Then I don't understand the reason for the delay!

SHINZON:
I came this far alone...

SURAN:
But surely...

SHINZON:
The Scimitar will serve my needs.

SURAN:
Praetor. You have the whole fleet at your disposal. They supported the coup, they'll follow you.

SHINZON:
None.

SURAN:
How many Warbirds will you need?

SHINZON:
It's imperative we retain their allegiance or our great mission will be strangled before it can truly draw breath.

SURAN:
They will obey, Praetor.

SHINZON:
And?

SURAN:
They're holding position.

SHINZON:
Join us, Commanders. Now what's the disposition of the fleet?
