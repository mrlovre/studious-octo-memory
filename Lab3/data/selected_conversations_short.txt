BERNICE:
That's a very nice compliment, and I'd like to say that...you've done the same for me.

MILTON:
Just in case I don't have a chance to say goodbye, I want you to know that I haven't spent so many pleasant hours for many years.

BERNICE:
No. I'm all alone.

MILTON:
I'm sure we'll both make it...but just in case one of us...well, is there a message you'd like me to give someone?

MILTON:
That's a lovely name. Mine's Milton...Milt Ettenhenim. But my friends call me 'Bubbles.'

BERNICE:
Mine's Eleanor. Eleanor Schiff.

MILTON:
You know, here we are having coffee together, and discussing education and business and economy...and we don't even know each other's names...full names I mean.

BERNICE:
I wish I could fool myself into believing that that's the reason. The truth of the matter is, nobody ever asked me.

MILTON:
I know the answer  Career. A smart woman like you became so involved in your work, you didn't have time for marriage.

BERNICE:
Well, I'm afraid that's a question that's all too easy to answer.

MILTON:
But I think it's time we stopped talking about me. A woman like you  why haven't you ever married?

BERNICE:
Well, after a thing like that you wouldn't be expected to.

MILTON:
After my wife died, I felt like a fifth wheel. You know, so many years being with one person  a very wonderful person  makes you always think of yourself as part of a pair...When Ethel passed away, I was lost. I couldn't function socially and I couldn't function in business.

MILTON:
No. I'm from Washington, D.C. I'm a lobbyist for the Small Businessmen's Assocation.

BERNICE:
Well, it really wasn't a vacation. You see, I'm a teacher in the New York City school system, and I was attending a seminar on visual aids to education. Are you from L.A.?

MILTON:
Were you vacationing in Los Angeles?

BERNICE:
No, thank you. I take it black. Like my men.

MILTON:
Thank you. Cream?

BERNICE:
Ah, won't you sit down?

BERNICE:
That's very nice of you. Thank you.

MILTON:
I happened to be passing, and I thought you might like some corfee.

MRS. KRAMER:
Shep, no! He gets so excited when new people are here.

CAREY:
...but after...awhile...you begin to...  ...get used to it.

MRS. KRAMER:
Shep, no! I'll bet you have exciting things happen all the time down there.

CAREY:
Yeah, something like that, but as I say, they didn't have time to tell me very much.

MRS. KRAMER:
Something about a plane with no pilot?

CAREY:
Well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.

MRS. KRAMER:
Shep, sit...sit! So, I understand you've got a real emergency down there.

MRS. KRAMER:
Oh, yes. Come in, Paul. Rex will be right out.

CAREY:
Hello, I'm Paul Carey from the airline. I'm here to pick up Captain Kramer.

STRIKER:
Excuse me, Doc, I've got a plane to land.

DR. RUMACK:
And the last thing he said to me, Doc, he said, Sometime when the crew is up against it and the breaks are beating the boys, tell them to go out there with all they've got and win just one for the Zipper. I don't know where I'll be then, Doc, he said, but I won't smell too good. That's for sure.

STRIKER:
George Zipp said that?

DR. RUMACK:
I'm doing everything I can!  And stop calling me Shirley!

STRIKER:
Surely there must be something you can do.

DR. RUMACK:
I won't deceive you, Mister Striker. We're running out of time.

STRIKER:
Yes, everything they've got. How are the passengers doing?

DR. RUMACK:
Will the hospital equipment be at the airport?

STRIKER:
Chicago, the passengers are beginning to panic. When do we start down?

DR. RUMACK:
...safe and sound and free to pursue a life of religious fulfillment.

STRIKER:
Let's see. Those are the flaps, that's the thrust, this must turn on the landing lights.

DR. RUMACK:
Elaine, I haven't time to put this gently, so I'll be very direct. Everyone of us on this plane is in a desperate situation. Mister Striker is the only hope we've got.

STRIKER:
Well, I flew singleengine fighters in the Air Force, but this plane has four engines. It's an entirely different kind of flying...uallu utogetheru!!!

DR. RUMACK:
I uamu serious, and don't call me Shirley! What flying experience have you had?

STRIKER:
Surely you can't be serious.

DR. RUMACK:
Can you fly this airplane and land it?

STRIKER:
Both pilots!

DR. RUMACK:
I'm not sure. I haven't seen anything like this since the Lina Wertmuller Film Festival.

OVEUR:
What is it, Doctor? What's happening?

OVEUR:
No, I mean we can't ulandu for another two hours. Fog has closed down everything this side of the mountains. We've got to go through to Chicago!

DR. RUMACK:
You can't take a guess for another two hours?

OVEUR:
Well...not for another two hours.

DR. RUMACK:
Can't you take a guess?

OVEUR:
I can't tell.

DR. RUMACK:
Captain, how soon can we land?

DR. RUMACK:
I think you ought to know what our chances are. The life of everyone on board depends on just one thing finding someone back there who not only can fly this plane, but who didn't have fish for dinner.

ELAINE:
No. No one that I know of.

ELAINE:
Well...

DR. RUMACK:
All right. Unless I can get all these people to a hospital quickly, I can't even be sure of saving their lives. Now, is there anyone else on board who can land this plane?

ELAINE:
No.

DR. RUMACK:
Elaine, you're a member of this crew. Can you face some unpleasant facts?

DR. RUMACK:
Extremely serious. It starts with a slight fever.

ELAINE:
Just how serious is it, doctor?

ELAINE:
He had fish, too.

DR. RUMACK:
Let's see now. The copilot had fish. What did the navigator eat?

ELAINE:
Doctor Rumack, Mister Hammen ate fish. And Randy says there are five more cases, and they ate fish, too.

ELAINE:
He had fish.

DR. RUMACK:
What did he have?

DR. RUMACK:
Yes, yes, I remember. I had lasagna.

ELAINE:
Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.

DR. RUMACK:
What was it we had for dinner tonight?

ELAINE:
Certainly.

DR. RUMACK:
It's a big building with patients. But that's not important right now. Tell the Captain I must speak to him.

ELAINE:
A hospital? What is it?

DR. RUMACK:
You'd better tell the Captain. We've got to land as soon as we can. This woman has to be gotten to a hospital.

DR. RUMACK:
Yes. Yes, of course.

ELAINE:
We have some passengers who are very sick. Could you come and take a look at them?

DR. RUMACK:
That's right.

ELAINE:
Sir. Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry to have to wake you. Are you a doctor?

ELAINE:
Uhhuh.

STRIKER:
See them, Elaine?

ELAINE:
The gear is down.

STRIKER:
Tell them the gear is down and we're ready to land.

ELAINE:
I wanted you to know  now  I'm very proud.

STRIKER:
Yes?

ELAINE:
Ted...

STRIKER:
I don't care. I just don't have what it takes. They'd be better off with someone who'd never flown before.

ELAINE:
But Ted, you're the only...

STRIKER:
Oil pressure. I forgot to check the oil pressure. When Kramer hears about this, the shit's gonna hit the fan.

ELAINE:
What happened, Ted? What went wrong?

STRIKER:
Rats! I've lost number three.

ELAINE:
It's a damn good thing you don't know how much he hates your guts.

STRIKER:
It's a damn good thing he doesn't know how much I hate his guts.

ELAINE:
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.

STRIKER:
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.

ELAINE:
And a little ice!

STRIKER:
And a little ice.

ELAINE:
Rain.

STRIKER:
That's what I've been trying to tell these people.

ELAINE:
Ted! What are you doing? You can't fly this plane!

STRIKER:
A lot of people made plans before the war. Like George Zipp.

ELAINE:
Ted, I don't want to stay here. It's time for us to go back home  to the plans we made before the war.

STRIKER:
I think they're getting the hang of it! When we reenlist I'll teach them baseball!

STRIKER:
That's Lieutennt Hurwitz. Severe shell shock. He thinks he's Ethel Merman.

ELAINE:
What's his problem?

ELAINE:
Be patient, Ted. No one expects you to get over this immediately.

STRIKER:
I wish I could say the same for George Zipp.

ELAINE:
Seven. Lieutenant Zipp died this morning. Ted, Doctor Sandler says you'll be out in a week. Isn't that wonderful?

STRIKER:
Is it? Because of my mistake six men didn't return from that raid.

ELAINE:
It's a big building where the generals meet. But that's not important right now. They've cleared you of any blame for what happened on that raid. Isn't that good news?

STRIKER:
Headquarters!? What is it?

ELAINE:
You got a telegram from headquarters today.

ELAINE:
But it won't be. Not as long as you insist on living in the past!

STRIKER:
That's the way I've always wanted it to be, Elaine.

ELAINE:
Mostly I remember...the nights when we were together. I remember how you used to hold me...and how I used to sit on your face and wriggle...and then afterwards how we'd watch until the sun came up. When it did, it was almost like...like each new day was created...only for us.

ELAINE:
I remember everything. All I have are memories.

STRIKER:
Elaine, just hear me out. I know things haven't been right for a long time. But it will be different...like it was in the beginning. Remember?

ELAINE:
I love you.

STRIKER:
I love you, Elaine.

ELAINE:
Oh, Ted, please be careful. I worry about you so much.

STRIKER:
My orders came through. My squadron ships out tomorrow. I'll be leading a very important mission.

ELAINE:
What's the matter?

ELAINE:
You...you shouldn't have come. I don't have time now.

STRIKER:
Elaine, I've got to talk to you.

ELAINE:
Ted, what are you doing here?

ELAINE:
It's too late, Ted. When I get back to Chicago, I'm going to start my life all over again. I'm sorry.

STRIKER:
But if you'll just give me...

ELAINE:
It's the truth. What's hurt you the most is your record since the war. Different cities, different jobs, and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility.

STRIKER:
You expect me to believe that?

ELAINE:
Your uwaru urecordu? You're the only one keeping that alive. For everyone else it's ancient history.

STRIKER:
You know I haven't been able to get near an airplane since the war. And even if I could, they wouldn't hire me because of my war record.

ELAINE:
Then why don't you take the job that Louie Netz offered you at Boeing?

STRIKER:
Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change.

ELAINE:
I won't be back. I've requested the Atlanta run.

STRIKER:
Look, you'll be back in town tomorrow night. We'll have dinner  talk it over.

ELAINE:
It takes so many things to make love last. Most of all it takes respect. And I can't live with a man I don't respect!

STRIKER:
Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?

ELAINE:
I have been patient and I've tried to help, but you wouldn't even let me do that.

STRIKER:
I know things haven't been right for a long time, but it'll be different. If you'll just be patient, I can work things out.

ELAINE:
I just don't want to go over it any more.

STRIKER:
I came home early and found your note. I guess you meant for me to read it later. Elaine, I've got to talk to you.

ELAINE:
Ted!

STRIKER:
Elaine!

OVEUR:
Find out if there's a doctor on board, as quietly as you can.

ELAINE:
I think so, but I've never seen it so acute.

OVEUR:
Airsick?

ELAINE:
Who wants to be first?

OVEUR:
Hey, we've been waiting for you. A little bit late tonight.

OVEUR:
Joey can stay up here for a while if he'd like to.

ELAINE:
We'd better get back now.

OVEUR:
Hello.

ELAINE:
We have a visitor.

SOLDIER:
Goodbye, darling.

GIRL:
Goodbye, darling. I love you. I love you, darling.

SOLDIER:
Goodbye, darling.

GIRL:
Bill! Bill! Goodbye, Bill.

SOLDIER:
So long, darling. Goodbye. Take care of yourself.

GIRL:
Oh, Bill, I'll keep it. I'll keep it with me all the time.

SOLDIER:
Goodbye, darling.

GIRL:
Every day.

SOLDIER:
You promise you'll write.

GIRL:
Oh, Bill, I'm going to miss you so much.

KRAMER:
All right, he's on final now! Put out all runway lights except niner.

GUNDERSON:
He's right on the heading.

KRAMER:
Watch your altitude, Striker. It's too erratic. You can't come straight in. You've got enough fuel left for two hours flying. You've got to stay up there 'til we get a break in the weather.

GUNDERSON:
He's all over the place! Nine hundred feet up to thirteen hundred feet! What an asshole!

KRAMER:
You are now eight miles from the airport. Turn right to a heading of zero eight niner, throttle back slightly and begin to lose altitude to fifteen hundred feet.

GUNDERSON:
Eight miles. Turn right to heading zero eight niner.

GUNDERSON:
Runway niner. It's the longest, and directly into the wind.

KRAMER:
Did you decide on a runway yet?

GUNDERSON:
Yes, Captain?

KRAMER:
And get that finger out of your ear. You don't know where that finger's been! Gunderson?

JACK:
Here.

SHIRLEY:
Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up.

JACK:
How ya doing, honey?

JACK:
What is it?

SHIRLEY:
Oh, I can't stand it.

SHIRLEY:
Well, it wasn't all that I had hoped.

JACK:
What did you think of 'Great Expectations?'

JACK:
Yeah, I think he is.  Hey, Fred!

SHIRLEY:
Jack, isn't that Fred Bliffert over there in the blue turtleneck? Maybe he's on our flight to Chicago.

MURDOCK:
The hell I don't! I'm out there busting my buns every night.

JOEY:
...and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs.

MURDOCK:
We are turning left to a heading of zero ninerniner.

JOEY:
...and that lots of times you don't even run down court.

MURDOCK:
Denver Control, this is Flight twozero niner intersecting Victor Airway seven ninerniner.

JOEY:
I think you're the greatest. But my Dad says you don't work hard enough on defense.

MURDOCK:
I'm an airline pilot.  Ah, Clarence, according to my calculations, with this tailwind we ought to be able to make up an additional fifteen minutes over the Rockies.

MURDOCK:
I think you should go back to your seat now, Joey. Right, Clarence?

JOEY:
You uareu Kareem. I've seen you play. My Dad's got season tickets!

MURDOCK:
I'm sorry, son, but you must have me confused with someone else. My name is Roger Murdock. I'm the copilot.

JOEY:
Wait a minute. I know you. You're Kareem Abdul Jabbar. You play basketball for the Los Angeles Lakers!

RANDY:
Okay, this is one of my favorites.

LISA:
Oh, I'd love to.

RANDY:
I thought maybe you'd like to hear a song.

LISA:
I'm Lisa. Oh, you have a guitar!

RANDY:
I'm Randy.

LISA:
Hi!

RANDY:
Oh, it's nothing to be alarmed about. We'll get back to you very quickly.

MRS. HAMMEN:
Yes, of course. We both had fish. Why?

RANDY:
Well, the doctor will be with you in just a moment. One thing do you know what he had for dinner?

MRS. HAMMEN:
Oh, Stewardess. My husband is very sick. Can you do something, please?

RANDY:
Yes?

MRS. HAMMEN:
I will, but Jim won't.

RANDY:
Would either of you like another cup of coffee?

MURDOCK:
All right. But just remember, my name is Roger Murdock.

OVEUR:
No, he's not bothering anyone. Let him stay up here.

OVEUR:
No, why don't you take care ot it?

MURDOCK:
Do you want me to check the weather, Clarence?

OVEUR:
Roger, Roger. What's our vector, Victor?

MURDOCK:
We have clearance, Clarence.

MURDOCK:
Huh?

OVEUR:
Roger.

MURDOCK:
Huh?

OVEUR:
Roger.

OVEUR:
Hi, Roger. Good to have you aboard. Victor, this is Roger Murdock.

MURDOCK:
Sorry, Clarence. Latest weather report shows everything socked in from Salt Lake to Lincoln.

SISTER ANGELINA:
Of course.

RANDY:
Could I borrow your guitar? I thought I might be able to cheer her up.

SISTER ANGELINA:
Oh yes, I saw. Poor child.

RANDY:
There's a little girl on board who's ill and...

SISTER ANGELINA:
Yes?

RANDY:
Excuse me, Sister?

STRIKER:
Thank you, Randy. You better leave sweetheart. You might get hurt in here.

RANDY:
Mr. Striker, the passengers are ready.

RANDY:
Would you go up, please?

STRIKER:
Well, I flew in the war, but that was a long time ago. I wouldn't know anything about it.

RANDY:
It's the little room at the front of the plane where the pilots sit. But that's not important right now. The first officer is ill and the Captain would like someone with flying experience to help him with the radio. Do you know anything about planes?

STRIKER:
The cockpit? What is it?

RANDY:
Excuse me, sir. There's been a little problem in the cockpit and I was wondering...

STRIKER:
No. No thank you.

RANDY:
Excuse me, sir. Would you like some coffee before we serve dinner?

STRIKER:
Oh  I haven't flown for a long time.

RANDY:
Do you feel all right, sir?

STRIKER:
Thank you.

RANDY:
FourteenB. It's halfway down on your right.

COMMISSIONER:
Commissioner, Aquarius.

KRUGER:
Kruger, Sagittarius.

KRUGER:
I was asking McCrosky, Commissioner.

COMMISSIONER:
Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor...

KRUGER:
What's the story?

COMMISSIONER:
I was reading too.

KRUGER:
Forget it.  I was reading.

KRUGER:
You've made your point, Commissioner. There's only one other pilot who can handle that shuttle and that's Clarence Oveur.  He's got a lunar flight today.  I want him pulled.  Jacobs, pull Oveur!

COMMISSIONER:
I told you, leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys down...

KRUGER:
I wonder how your boys in Washington are going to take this one.

COMMISSIONER:
That just doesn't make any sense.

KRUGER:
That's right, Commissioner.  Senselessly murdered just minutes ago.

KRUGER:
I just wish it was that simple.

COMMISSIONER:
What?

KRUGER:
Commissioner.

COMMISSIONER:
You handle your front office people, I'll handle the press and leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys downtown to the boys on the board.

COMMISSIONER:
Bud, get wise to the political realities. The boys on the board are under a lot of pressure from the boys downtown.

KRUGER:
And what do the boys on the board know about safety, Commissioner?  Let umeu talk to them.

COMMISSIONER:
Forget it.  The boys on the board want that shuttle to go on schedule.

KRUGER:
Commissioner, we both know the Mercury shuttle needs another month of prelaunch testing.

MARY:
Um...  Do you people scream right when you... you know.

DUNN:
What is it, Mary?

MARY:
Yes it did.  Mr. Dunn, can I ask you a personal question?

DUNN:
Felt like a large asteroid.

MARY:
Yes I did...

DUNN:
Did you feel that?

OVEUR:
You better take this.

DUNN:
Sir?

OVEUR:
Dunn.

OVEUR:
You better check on it, Mr. Dunn.  I'll stay here and fly the ship.

DUNN:
Sir, I've got an overload in disposal unit four.

OVEUR:
You better check it, Unger.

DUNN:
We seem to have a malfunction in disposal unit four, sir.

DUNN:
Accelerators down.

OVEUR:
Shut down accelerators.

OVEUR:
Dunn.

DUNN:
Oveur.

TED:
Kramer, the WORP control handle just came off in my hand.

ELAINE:
Ted, the lever!

ELAINE:
Compute!

TED:
Now!

ELAINE:
Set!

TED:
We've blown the computer!  Elaine!  Set course change!

TED:
I guess you'd have to be a fool not to be afraid at a time like this.

ELAINE:
Not when I'm with you, Ted.

TED:
Are you afraid?

TED:
The sun will heat that thing to over 450 degrees within seconds.  He'll roast like a pig on a spit.

ELAINE:
What will happen to him, Ted?

TED:
That's right  premature ejection.

ELAINE:
You mean...

TED:
Sit down, Elaine.  If this bomb trick works we just might make it.  Simon was a fool to eject now.

ELAINE:
Simon just ejected!

TED:
That might be the news we've been waiting for.

ELAINE:
I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will.

TED:
Well, Elaine, this might be it if those guys on the ground don't think of something.

ELAINE:
That was very well put, Ted.

TED:
Kurtz was the one who got us into this mess in the first place.  You people knew this ship wasn't ready to fly.  You played God with over a hundred lives, Kruger, and for what  the prestige of your precious space program.

ELAINE:
I mean until we start to burn up.

TED:
Not now, Elaine.

ELAINE:
Ted, we've only got ten minutes.

ELAINE:
Ted, please be careful.

TED:
Elaine, I'm going back there.  Just hold onto that stick and try to control this hunk of tin as best you can.

ELAINE:
Ted, there's no time to explain.

TED:
Elaine, what's going on?

ELAINE:
Ted!

TED:
Elaine!

ELAINE:
Ted, a toilet's not going to kill anyone.

TED:
There's something dangerously wrong with this ship, Elaine.  I know its the wiring. That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg.

ELAINE:
I'd use the word insane.

TED:
What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face.

ELAINE:
The word is sick.  Ted  very, very, very sick.

TED:
What word would you use, Elaine?

ELAINE:
I've never used the word insane, Ted.

TED:
Then you udou think I'm insane.

ELAINE:
Ted, get a grip on yourself.  You should never have left the hospital.

TED:
Elaine, I mean the mission has to be aborted.  This ship should never have passed FSA inspection.  This thing is held together by string and chewing gum.

ELAINE:
We can't go back.  We had something very special, but it's all over.

TED:
Elaine, we have to go back.

ELAINE:
Ted.  I don't know why you got on this flight.  I don't know what you're trying to prove.

TED:
Elaine.

ELAINE:
Ted!

TED:
Not now, Elaine!

ELAINE:
Ted.

TED:
I've got it, Elaine!  I've figured out what's wrong with the shuttle!

ELAINE:
What are you doing, Ted?

TED:
Let me by, Elaine.

ELAINE:
Ted, we're taking off!

TED:
I have to get in there.  I have to stop this flight.

ELAINE:
Ted!  What are you...?

ELAINE:
Goodbye, Ted.  I don't want to hurt you.

TED:
That's the way I want it.  Just turn the radio on and go.

ELAINE:
If that's the way you want it.

TED:
No goodbyes, Elaine.  Just go.

ELAINE:
Ted, you must remember what the doctor said, the first step on the road to sanity is admitting that you're sick.  Now take your electroshock and you'll be back at the space center in no time.  And by the way, Ted, I'm leaving you for Simon.

TED:
His name's David Stockman.  He's been here twenty years, that's all he says.

ELAINE:
And when are you going to realize, Ted, that your mental hygiene is the most important thing right now.

TED:
Elaine, when are you going to realize Simon Kurtz put me in here to get me out of the way.

TED:
Sammy Davis Junior.  Terrible car accident.  He hasn't been the same since.

ELAINE:
Who's that, Ted?

ELAINE:
Eat this spaghetti, Ted.  It'll make you feel a lot better.

ELAINE:
Ted, I loved you and I'll always love you. But I need Simon.  He's stable.  He's a good provider.  I want that at this stage of the game, Ted.  He might have his faults, but Simon doesn't know the meaning of the word fear and I need that in a man.

TED:
Elaine, what happened to us?

ELAINE:
Ted, please.  You're just making things difficult for yourself.

TED:
Elaine.

TED:
You're as bad as the rest of them, Elaine!  It's all here in the design specifications!  Look!  It's all here!

ELAINE:
Let's relax tonight, just the two of us. I'll make a quiet Italian dinner just the way you like it, with spaghetti.

TED:
There's nothing wrong with me!

ELAINE:
Ted, you're overworked.  You've been flying yourself into the ground.

TED:
Ask Simon.

ELAINE:
Ted, what's wrong?

TED:
I mean the Mercury flight.  It's not safe and, Kurtz, you know why.

ELAINE:
But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.

TED:
It's got to be stopped!

TED:
That's not important now, Elaine.  We have to talk.

ELAINE:
Te...!

TED:
Elaine.

RUMACK:
Yes  last week that pile of mud was only this high.

ELAINE:
Is he making any progress, Doctor?

RUMACK:
The brain is an amazingly complex organ, Elaine.

ELAINE:
Is that a good sign, Doctor?

RUMACK:
You can be gentle with him, Elaine.  He's been working out a lot of his aggressions here in the garden.

ELAINE:
I mean for Ted.

RUMACK:
You can eat balanced meals, exercise, and take Geritol.

ELAINE:
What can uIu do, Doctor Rumack?

RUMACK:
So you see, our task isn't made any easier by Ted's refusal to admit that he's sick.

RUMACK:
The human brain is a highly complex organ, Elaine, perhaps the most complex next to the bladder.  Let me show you.  Ted's problem is in this area.  This area, this area, here, here, here, under here, here...

ELAINE:
Ted seemed to get worse after I told him about Simon, Doctor.

ELAINE:
Simon, what are you saying?!

SIMON:
Maybe.

ELAINE:
Simon, I didn't want it to end like this. We can be friends!  You'll die out there.

ELAINE:
Your career!  What about the lives of those people out there.  Simon, what happened to the man I thought I loved?

SIMON:
My career is shot.

SIMON:
We're computer locked and the manual navigation unit is down.

ELAINE:
Can't we change course?

SIMON:
He tried to disconnect ROK.  It gassed him.  That computer is running this ship and we're heading right for the sun.

ELAINE:
Simon, what's happening?!

SIMON:
Roger.

ELAINE:
Simon, I'm going to check ROK's secondary readout unit.

SIMON:
That's my girl.

ELAINE:
I think so.

SIMON:
Have you got it straightened out now?

ELAINE:
Don't be too long.

SIMON:
Meet me onboard, sweetheart.  I have to pick up a few things at the drugstore.

SIMON:
So mentally ill?

ELAINE:
Simon, why has he become so... so...

SIMON:
Elaine!  Ted's a danger to himself, he's a threat to this mission and his behavior does absolutely nothing to promote peace in the Middle East.

ELAINE:
No, I've been excited before.

SIMON:
I guess this is a first for you.

ELAINE:
I'm so excited, Simon.

SIMON:
Frank's the best pilot in the program.

SIMON:
You're heading up the division in charge of babies for Mr. and Mrs. Simon Kurtz.

ELAINE:
But, darling, they've offered me a chance to head up the computer analysis division for the Jupiter probe.

SIMON:
Women uandu the space program have come a long way, sweetheart.  But after the wedding, no more complicated computers for my little girl.

ELAINE:
And I can hardly believe that I'm engaged to someone like you, Simon.  I'm a very lucky woman.

SIMON:
Who would believe that Elaine Thompson was once a stewardess on the DenverChicago run.

ELAINE:
Simon.

SIMON:
For the best little computer officer on the Mercury mission.

OVEUR:
Roger.  You better get back there and monitor the regulatory unit.

ELAINE:
No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.

OVEUR:
I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.

ELAINE:
You can do it from up here, Captain.

OVEUR:
Roger.

ELAINE:
We have to disconnect ROK's higher brain functions without disturbing his regulatory system.

OVEUR:
I see.  What do you think our alternatives are?

ELAINE:
I don't think we have any alternative, Captain.

ELAINE:
Yes, sir.

OVEUR:
Elaine, ask ROK for a field interference scan.  Those sun spots might give us a problem with our communications.

ROK:
There's nothing wrong with me, Elaine. What about tonight  just you and me.  We can be alone.  I can get rid of everyone else on the ship  I've already proven uthatu.

ELAINE:
Request selfanalysis of ROK hardware and software systems regarding behavioral changes.

ROK:
Life support check.  Elaine, it's obvious you've been ignoring me.  You're a woman. I can relate to that.

ELAINE:
Request life support systems check.

ROK:
Systems check positive.  Look, Elaine, I...

ELAINE:
Request comprehensive electrical systems check.

ROK:
You have great tits.

ELAINE:
Go ahead.

ROK:
Can I say something of a personal nature to you?

ELAINE:
That's okay, ROK.

ROK:
Elaine, I'm sorry about that little outburst a moment ago.

ROK:
Cut the Doubting Thomas shit, Elaine.  I know where I'm coming from on this.

ELAINE:
That's not possible.

ROK:
Negative.

ELAINE:
That doesn't make sense.  Repeat analysis.

ROK:
Negative.

ELAINE:
Intermitant failure in scan mode R. Analyze.

JOHN:
Look, a man can make an honest mistake!! Anyway, she was asking for it!  They're all asking for it all the time!!

JIMMY:
No more kids yelling, 'Your old man's a thieving rapist'?

JOHN:
How many kids get a chance to live on another planet.

JOHN:
It's going to be terrific.  A whole new world, new kids to play with.

JIMMY:
Do you think things will be a lot different on Mercury, Dad?

JOHN:
I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury.

JIMMY:
I sure an glad they let Scraps ride up here with us.

JOHN:
We'll have to check, Jimmy.  It's a pretty long trip to Mercury.

JIMMY:
Will Scraps be able to sit with us, Dad?

OVEUR:
Do you like it when Scraps sleeps on his back, Jimmy?

JIMMY:
Yeah.

OVEUR:
He's a boy dog.

JIMMY:
Sure.

OVEUR:
Can I hold him?

JIMMY:
Scraps.

OVEUR:
Come on up, Jimmy.  Say, that's some puppy.  What's his name?

WIFE:
What...?

JOE:
All right.  Here.

WIFE:
Okay, Joey.  The Doc says you gotta relax. This hospital in Des Moines is the best sex clinic in the country.

JOE:
I don't want to hear that word!

WIFE:
Joey, what's more important, the kids' clothes or your sexual potency.

JOE:
We've spent everything on these operations.  Is it really worth it?  We've pawned your mother's wedding ring.  The kids have no winter clothes...

WIFE:
Take this, Joey.  It's my last few bucks. You'll need a hot meal when you get there.

TED:
I'm sure.

JOE:
You're sure?

TED:
That's right, Joe.  Now, no one's going to hurt you and no one has to know what's wrong with you.

JOE:
What?

TED:
Joe, the insurance policy won't help your wife and kids.  You bought auto insurance, not life insurance.

JOE:
I don't want to live anymore.

TED:
Joe, you don't want to blow that thing and kill all these innocent people.

OVEUR:
Have you tried it with a little cinnamon?

MARY:
Captain, the coffee machine is jammed and I don't like it.

OVEUR:
Poached!  Not over!  Over!

MARY:
All right, Captain Oveur.  Over.

OVEUR:
That's how I want them.  Poached.  Over.

OVEUR:
Just poached on toast.  Over.

MARY:
Poached uandu over, Captain Oveur?  Over.

OVEUR:
No.  Poached.  Over.

MARY:
How would you like your eggs, Captain? Over.

OVEUR:
A couple eggs and juice would be nice, Mary.  Over.

TED:
Anything.  Just don't let Salucci think we're onto him.

MARY:
What should I say?

TED:
No, a bomb.  Now, as discreetly as possible, I want you to move the passengers into the lounge.

MARY:
A b...

TED:
He's carrying a bomb.

MARY:
Sixteen 'C', why?

TED:
Which passenger is Joe Salucci?

OVEUR:
Yes, sir, commander.  This is Mercury One.  Everything seems A okay up here and ready for countdown.

SIMON:
Whenever your're ready, Captain.

SIMON:
Captain Oveur, your navigator, Mr. Unger, and your first officer, Mr. Dunn.

OVEUR:
Good to be aboard, gentlemen.

OVEUR:
Do you think it's necessary to explain ueverythingu?

SIMON:
That's how dry cleaning works.  Now I'd like to quickly go over the digestive system of amphibians.

SIMON:
We don't have much time.  Let's move. I'll explain everything.

OVEUR:
Mr. Kurtz, I presume.

SIMON:
Captain Oveur?

STELLA:
Now he's DYINGing and wants to be buried on Mercury.

PORTER:
Ah, yes, the Institute, I'm familiar with it.

STELLA:
Let's go, Daddy.  We have to check in.  He was never appreciated at the Institute.

PORTER:
It's a privilege to meet you, sir, I'm familiar with all your work.

STELLA:
Yes.

PORTER:
Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist?

STELLA:
Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.

PORTER:
You folks need any help?

RECEPTIONIST:
But that's not a door.  The door's over there.

TED:
Don't try to stop me!

RECEPTIONIST:
You can't go in there!

RECEPTIONIST:
Death, death.  How about the first Thursday in March, ten o'clock.

TED:
All right, it's a matter of death.

RECEPTIONIST:
You'll have to be more specific than that, sir.

TED:
No, dammit.  It's a matter of life or death.

RECEPTIONIST:
Do you have an appointment, sir?

TED:
I have to see Bud Kruger.

TED:
Pull yourself together!  We've got to...

SIMON:
Don't talk to me about Elaine.  Outta my way!

TED:
Then Elaine was right.

SIMON:
That damn computer has taken over.  I'm getting out.

TED:
Kurtz, you're drunk.  Who's in command of this ship?

SIMON:
Striker.

TED:
I know you've been subtly spreading the word that I'm having a breakdown.

SIMON:
You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications.

TED:
Look at this wiring.  It's shorting out under high temperatures.

SIMON:
You're seeing bugs where they don't exist, Striker.

SIMON:
That's right, Striker.  And we're getting married when we return.

TED:
Are you on the Mercury mission?

TED:
Well, we laughed.  We laughed all the time.

STELLA:
No.  It's hard to LAUGH when your father's dying.

TED:
I just wish it was that simple.  We really were in love.  You know how it is when you laugh all the time.

STELLA:
Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love.

TED:
Sure.  But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged.

STELLA:
Not if the people change together in relation to that love.

TED:
People change in relation to each other. Love changes on its own.

STELLA:
Love's the same as it always was.  It's people who change.

TED:
We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore.

STELLA:
No.  I mean your relationship.

TED:
I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me.

STELLA:
Do you want to talk about it.

STELLA:
No, I mean your head.  Sit down.  I'll take a look at it.  I'm a nurse.

TED:
I'm getting over it.  If a relationship isn't working, you can't force it.

STELLA:
You've been hurt.

STELLA:
You don't have to excuse yourself.  I'm a nurse.  I understand.

TED:
I'm familiar with your work, Doctor. You'll have to excuse me, I have to go.

STELLA:
Yes.  He's dying uandu wants to be buried on Mercury.

TED:
Not Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist?

STELLA:
You don't have to thank me, I'm a nurse. This is my father, Dr. Barrington.

TED:
Uh... oh, thank you.  It's nothing.

STELLA:
Excuse me, are you alright?  I noticed you talking to yourself.  I'm a nurse.  Can I be of some help?

CORNELIUS WALDMAN:
Herr Falkstein  you must go at once and present Dr. Frankenstein with all the details of his inheritance.  The estate will provide for your journey.

ANASTASIA:
Oh, shit.

CORNELIUS WALDMAN:
He is the fifth leading authority in his field.

ANASTASIA:
And has he achieved...any special degree of eminence?

CORNELIUS WALDMAN:
Yes, my dear, he is.

ANASTASIA:
Excuse me, Mr. Waldman  excuse me for interrupting.  But is Frederick, then...a medical doctor?

BURGOMEISTER:
Now wait a minute!

FREDDY:
I think we all need a good night's sleep.  Why don't we meet next week and thrash this thing out?

FREDDY:
Poppycock!

BURGOMEISTER:
They say, also, that you have recreated the horrible monster who, for so many years, has haunted and terrorized the Godfearing people of this village.  What say you to that?

FREDDY:
Ugly, vicious rumous.

BURGOMEISTER:
Forgive me for intruding so late at night, Herr Baron.  But an ugly rumor has it that there are strange goings on in this castle.  These good citizens are ready to rip you from limb to limb unless you can offer some rational explanation for their fears.  How say you?

FREDDY:
Victor Frankenstein.

BURGOMEISTER:
What was your grandfather's name?

FREDDY:
No!

BURGOMEISTER:
The grandson of Victor 'Fronkonsteen'?

FREDDY:
Dr. Frederick Fronkonsteen.

BURGOMEISTER:
And who might you be?

FREDDY:
You have the wrong house.

BURGOMEISTER:
Frederick Frankenstein?

FREDDY:
... No!

CARLSON:
Yes, sir.  Do you want the other cauliflower?

FREDDY:
Bring me some surgical gauze, a little tape and some disinfectant.

CARLSON:
Yes, sir?

FREDDY:
Carlson!

FREDDY:
He has a big mouth.  Yes!  It seems to me I did read something about that incident as a student.  But you have to remember that a worm  with very few exceptions  is not a human being.

CARLSON:
Yes, sir.

CARLSON:
Yes, sir.

FREDDY:
Give him an extra dollar.

FREDDY:
Here!  This cauliflower is useless to me.

CARLSON:
No, sir.  It will never happen again.

FREDDY:
Are you trying to make me look like an idiot?

CARLSON:
Yes, sir.  But I must have taken the wrong one when we came up.

FREDDY:
Didn't you prepare it with the celery before my lecture?

CARLSON:
From your office, sir.

FREDDY:
Where did you get this cauliflower?

CORNELIUS WALDMAN:
I have taken an oath that each letter of this testament shall be executed...and by God, it shall be done!

HERR FALKSTEIN:
Yes, sir.

CORNELIUS WALDMAN:
Herr Falkstein! You have your instructions!

HERR FALKSTEIN:
'Functional areas of the cerebrum in relation to the skull.'

CORNELIUS WALDMAN:
What lecture could be more important than the will of Baron Beaufort Frankenstein?

HERR FALKSTEIN:
Yes, sir, he was.  But he said he was obligated to lecture at Johns Hopkins University.

CORNELIUS WALDMAN:
Was he aware of the importance of this occasion?

HERR FALKSTEIN:
But I received a cable only this morning, saying that he could not come.

HERR FALKSTEIN:
I did, sir.

CORNELIUS WALDMAN:
Herr Falkstein!  Did you inform Frederick Frankenstein of this assembly and all the particulars of the time and place?

MONSTER:
MMmmm.

ELIZABETH:
So this is what it's like to be completely happy!

MONSTER:
MMmmm.

ELIZABETH:
Love me oodles and oodles?

MONSTER:
MMmmm.

ELIZABETH:
Still happy you married me?

MONSTER:
MMmmm.

ELIZABETH:
Did you see?...I put a special hamper in the bathroom just for your shirts.  the other one is just for socks and poopoo undies.

ELIZABETH:
Probably just some nearby cottage. Nothing to worry about.

MONSTER:
MMMMM!  MMMMM!

ELIZABETH:
Is it that music?

MONSTER:
MMMmm!

ELIZABETH:
All right then... seven's always been my lucky number.

MONSTER:
MMMmmmm.

ELIZABETH:
You're incorrigible!... Aren't you?

MONSTER:
Baack!

ELIZABETH:
What?

MONSTER:
Baack!

ELIZABETH:
What in God's name are you doing?

ELIZABETH:
I...

IGOR:
Miss me?

ELIZABETH:
Well... yes.

IGOR:
Surprised?

ELIZABETH:
Hello...?

IGOR:
Darling!

ELIZABETH:
That's my good boy.

FREDDY:
Good night.

ELIZABETH:
Of course I am.  Now give me a kiss and say good night like my good boy.

FREDDY:
I suppose you're right.

ELIZABETH:
Is it worth taking a chance?

FREDDY:
That's a tough choice.

ELIZABETH:
Would you want me, now, like this, so soon before our wedding? ... So near we can almost touch it? Or wait a little while longer, when I can give myself without hesitation?... When I can be totally and unashamedly yours??

FREDDY:
I don't want to spoil anything  I just want to top it all off.

ELIZABETH:
Oh, darling!  Don't let's spoil everything.

FREDDY:
Yes, but... I thought, perhaps tonight, under the circumstances, I might... stay here with you.

ELIZABETH:
Is your room just down the hall? ... in case I get frightened during the night?

ELIZABETH:
Of course I am.  Now come along like a good boy.

FREDDY:
I suppose you're right.

ELIZABETH:
You've done everything that's humanly possible, Frederick.  Oh, darling, I'm so worried about you  you need rest.

FREDDY:
Oh, Delbruck, Delbruck.  Was will dien tachlas von Dir?

ELIZABETH:
But you can't do that at night. And even if you could  it would cost a fortune.  Come to bed, darling.

FREDDY:
But there's a genius inside that body  crying out for love and understanding and normal human relationships.  I just have to find some way to reestablish his communications system.

ELIZABETH:
Darling, you mustn't worry so.

FREDDY:
Poor Delbruck!  There must be some way to reach him  to control that body.

FREDDY:
All right then!

ELIZABETH:
No, of course not.  I just meant...

FREDDY:
Are you suggesting I call him master???

ELIZABETH:
Why does he call you 'master'?

FREDDY:
Yes, he's a little bit... tilted. Harmless, though.

ELIZABETH:
What a strange fellow.

FREDDY:
Give me a hand with these, will you, Ayegor?

ELIZABETH:
Yes.  I am a bit tired, after all.

FREDDY:
Ready, darling?

FREDDY:
I mean, it's been a long day. I'm sure you must be as tired as I am.  Oh!  These are my assistants  Inga and Ayegor.

ELIZABETH:
Darling!?!

FREDDY:
Love you! ...Well, why don't we turn in?

ELIZABETH:
Love me?

FREDDY:
Surprised!

ELIZABETH:
Surprised?

FREDDY:
Darling!

ELIZABETH:
Darling!

FREDDY:
Goodbye, darling!

ELIZABETH:
Goodbye, darling.

ELIZABETH:
Goodbye, darling.

FREDDY:
I will!  Goodbye, darling!

FREDDY:
You bet your boots it does.

ELIZABETH:
Does that mean you love me?

FREDDY:
You're incorrigible!

ELIZABETH:
I've trimmed the list to only our very closest friends...but it still comes to three thousand.

FREDDY:
Whatever makes you happy.

ELIZABETH:
I hope you like large weddings.

FREDDY:
Oh, nice.

ELIZABETH:
Mother's going to help me with the invitations.

FREDDY:
Very....very!

ELIZABETH:
Will you miss me?

FREDDY:
Oh, darling  so will I.

ELIZABETH:
Oh, darling  I'll count the hours that you're away.

FREDDY:
I promise.

ELIZABETH:
Promise??

FREDDY:
Yes.

ELIZABETH:
Call me from New York before you leave??

FREDDY:
Yes, don't worry.

ELIZABETH:
And your passport?

FREDDY:
Yes.

ELIZABETH:
You have your tickets?

FREDDY:
Of course.

ELIZABETH:
Darling!...you will be careful!?

FREDDY:
Elizabeth!?!  'Can't waits any longer.  Arrive in your arms at ten tonight.' Oh, God!  Not tonight.

FRAU BLUCHER:
This wire came while you were gone. Your fiancee will be arriving any moment.

FREDDY:
What are you waiting around for, pickle puss?

FREDDY:
Good.

FRAU BLUCHER:
I put her in the guest room, just down the hall.

FREDDY:
I don't think so.  Is my assistant taken care of?

FRAU BLUCHER:
Will there be anything else?

FREDDY:
Well... we'll see.

FRAU BLUCHER:
I think you must be mistaken, sir.

FREDDY:
Surely he kept his notes  his private papers and records in some other place?

FRAU BLUCHER:
This is the only library I know of.

FREDDY:
well, there was a public and a private library  he said so in his will.  these books are all very general  any doctor might have them in his study.

FRAU BLUCHER:
I don't know what you mean, sir.

FREDDY:
I see.  And where is my grandfather's private library?

FRAU BLUCHER:
Yes, this was Victor's... the Baron's medical library.

FREDDY:
There seem to be quite a few books.

FREDDY:
May I have it, please?

FRAU BLUCHER:
No!  Dr. Frankenstein always kept that separate.

FREDDY:
Yes!... the laboratory.

FRAU BLUCHER:
You mean... the laboratory??

FREDDY:
Does that include the key to the laboratory?

FRAU BLUCHER:
You'll fine the keys to all the rooms in my cas... all the rooms in your castle on this ring.  I'll leave it on the table here.

FREDDY:
It seems fine.

FRAU BLUCHER:
I hope you find this comfortable. This was Baron Victor's room.

HERR FALKSTEIN:
Saturday night, yes, sir.  Have a pleasant journey!

FREDDY:
Saturday night then!  I'll take the train to New York and fly from there.

HERR FALKSTEIN:
Not at all  a great privilege, Doctor.

FREDDY:
Well, thank you very much for all your trouble.

HERR FALKSTEIN:
One week  I'll see to it, sir.

FREDDY:
One week at the most!?

HERR FALKSTEIN:
Yes, sir.

FREDDY:
All right then, I suppose I owe the family that much.  You'll have everything ready for me when I arrive?

HERR FALKSTEIN:
The old violinist  you smashed his violin over your knee.

FREDDY:
I didn't do that.

HERR FALKSTEIN:
Break that old man's violin.

FREDDY:
What?

HERR FALKSTEIN:
Why did you do that?

FREDDY:
Well... if you're sure that I could accomplish everything in a week... I suppose I could manage it.

FREDDY:
I'll have to think it over.  It's not so easy just to pick up and...

HERR FALKSTEIN:
A week.  Ten days at most.

FREDDY:
How long will this whole thing take?

HERR FALKSTEIN:
Do you have a hundred thousand of them, sir?

FREDDY:
But I can't just drop everything and leave.  I have responsibilities and obligations.

HERR FALKSTEIN:
Oh, at least, sir.  The land alone is worth a small fortune.

HERR FALKSTEIN:
My name is Gerhart Falkstein.

FREDDY:
Fron kon steen!

HERR FALKSTEIN:
Dr. Frankenstein?

FREDDY:
My grandfather's work was DooDoo! Dead is Dead!  There's only one thing I am interested in... and that is the preservation of LIFE!

MEDICAL STUDENT:
But your grandfather's work, sir...

FREDDY:
You have more chance of reanimating this knife than you have of mending a broken nervous system,

FREDDY:
I am a scientist...!  not a philosopher.

MEDICAL STUDENT:
But, sir...

FREDDY:
Hearts and kidneys are Tinker Toys! I'm talking about the Central Nervous System.

MEDICAL STUDENT:
But look at what's been done with hearts and kidneys!

FREDDY:
Nineteen!  My dear young man... once the human organism has ceased to function, nature has deemed that creature to be dead.

MEDICAL STUDENT:
Nineteen, sir.

FREDDY:
How old are you, young man?

MEDICAL STUDENT:
Yes, but, sir... if it could be accomplished, wouldn't that eliminate disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death?

FREDDY:
You are talking about the gibberish ravings of a lunatic mind.

MEDICAL STUDENT:
But aren't you the least bit curious about it, Doctor?  Doesn't the secret of life hold any intrigue for you?

FREDDY:
My father was a sick man.

MEDICAL STUDENT:
But wasn't that the whole basis of your grandfathers work, sir...? the reanimation of component parts?

FREDDY:
Are you speaking of the worm, or ... the spaghetti.

MEDICAL STUDENT:
Vermicelli.

FREDDY:
A piece of what?

MEDICAL STUDENT:
Isn't it true that Darwin preserved a piece of vermicelli in a glass case until, by some extraordinary means, it actually began to move with voluntary motion?

FREDDY:
Yes?

MEDICAL STUDENT:
Dr. Fronkonsteen!

FREDDY:
In conclusion... it should be noted that more than common injury to the nerve roots is always serious, because... once a nerve fibber is severed... there is no way to regenerate life back into it.  Are there any more questions before we leave?

FREDDY:
Very good!  Since our lab work today is a demonstration of just that distinction... why don't we proceed?

MEDICAL STUDENT:
Well sir... I'm not sure I understand the distinction between 'Reflexive' and 'Voluntary' nerve impulses.

FREDDY:
I prefer, by far, to be remembered for my own small contributions to science.  Now if we can proceed to your questions.

FREDDY:
That's true!  But my grandfather, Victor was, after all, what we might politely refer to as... a cuckoo!

MEDICAL STUDENT:
But aren't you the grandson of the famous Dr. Victor Frankenstein?... who performed such fascinating experiments in electricity and galvanism?

FREDDY:
No, it's Dr. Fronkonsteen!

MEDICAL STUDENT:
Oh!  I thought it was Dr. Frankenstein.

FREDDY:
My name is pronounced Fron kon steen.

MEDICAL STUDENT:
I beg your pardon?

FREDDY:
That's 'Fronkonsteen.'

IGOR:
Okay, boss!  But I hope you know what you're doing.

FREDDY:
It's the only way.

IGOR:
Yes, master.  Are you sure you want to go through with it?

FREDDY:
Is everything ready?

IGOR:
Come on, big fellow!

IGOR:
I'll bet it's a doozy.

FREDDY:
There's only one way.

IGOR:
I like your style, master.  How do we get him here?

FREDDY:
... and equalize the imbalance in his cerebrospinal fluid...

IGOR:
That sound good, boss.

FREDDY:
No!  The only hope now is to get him back here.  If I can just find a way to relieve the pressure on his cerebellum...

IGOR:
He's carrying her off now through the woods.

FREDDY:
What???

IGOR:
You don't understand, Master. The big fellow's broken in and kidnapped your fiancee.

IGOR:
What d'ya mean What monster?' You remember...the one we madein the basement.

FREDDY:
What monster?

IGOR:
Come on, Froderick  none of that.

FREDDY:
I'm a failure.

IGOR:
That's what we're paid for.

FREDDY:
Thanks...for all your help.

FREDDY:
Maybe...if you get here on time.

IGOR:
Can you play it?

FREDDY:
Bring  me  the  violin!

IGOR:
How do you know it was a 'she'?

FREDDY:
All right  where is she?

IGOR:
How do you know it was a 'he'?

FREDDY:
Where is he?

IGOR:
Someone was playing this in the music room.

FREDDY:
What did you find out?

IGOR:
How's it going?

FREDDY:
Act casual!

IGOR:
Yes, Master!

FREDDY:
Ayegor!  Find out where that music is coming from as quietly and as blindingly fast as you can.

IGOR:
It seem to have stopped the big fellow in his tracks.

FREDDY:
... Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.

IGOR:
No, no!  That whole thing!

FREDDY:
... I'm glad that's...

IGOR:
Repeat it anyway  it's a wonderful cue.

FREDDY:
I'm not trying to be funny.

IGOR:
What's the point of my setup? It's not funny unless you repeat exactly what you said.

FREDDY:
Why?

IGOR:
You're just supposed to repeat what you said.

FREDDY:
Yes.

IGOR:
You can say that again.

FREDDY:
Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.

FREDDY:
Give  me  your  hand!

IGOR:
Original.

IGOR:
careful, master  you never can tell with these chaps.

FREDDY:
But don't you see...the brain of Hans Delbruck is inside this grotesque hulk  pleading with us.  I've got to untie it.

IGOR:
Don't fall for that one.

FREDDY:
It's trying to talk.  it wants us to take off the straps.

FREDDY:
I suppose you're right.  Inga! Prepare a sedative, just in case.

IGOR:
Better not get too close, master. This guy could kill you.

IGOR:
It wasn't me.

FREDDY:
But you did  I just heard it.

IGOR:
I didn't make a 'yummy' sound  I just asked what it was.

FREDDY:
To you!  You just made a 'yummy' sound, so I thought you liked the dessert.

IGOR:
Who are you talking to?

FREDDY:
Oh, do you like it?  I'm not partial to desserts, but this is excellent.

FREDDY:
You're right!  Selfpity never got anyone anywhere.  Let's go back and finish our dinner.

IGOR:
I'm not that sort you know.  I appreciate you feelings, but try to show them some other way.

FREDDY:
I'm sorry.  I don't mean to take out my frustration on you.  You've been a great help to me, and I've let you down.

IGOR:
You'll be getting me sad next.

IGOR:
Well, I don't like to see you mope.

FREDDY:
Don't try to cheer me up that way.

IGOR:
You mustn't take it so hard. Bucharest wasn't built in a day.

FREDDY:
Cold!  Cold and dead!

FREDDY:
But there must be a reason. This is science, not art.

IGOR:
You can't win 'em all.

IGOR:
Wait till he sees the bill.

FREDDY:
Throw the third switch!

IGOR:
What?

FREDDY:
More, do you hear me?

IGOR:
What?

FREDDY:
It's not enough.  More!  More, do you hear me?

IGOR:
This guy means business.

FREDDY:
Throw the second switch!

IGOR:
You've got it, master.

FREDDY:
Yes!  When I give the word  throw the first switch!

IGOR:
Tonight?

FREDDY:
The ancient masters promised impossibilities and performed nothing.  We shall penetrate into the recesses of nature.  We shall ascend into the Heavens.  We shall command the thunders of Heaven, mimic the earthquake and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows.

FREDDY:
All right... elevate me!

IGOR:
You'd better hurry  I think it's going to rain.

IGOR:
Yes, master.  Just don't turn on any radios.

FREDDY:
Yes!  It's all written down in the notes.  Tie off the kites and come down!

IGOR:
You're sure you know what you're doing?

IGOR:
Thank you, Master.

FREDDY:
If you like  just hurry!

IGOR:
It's always been one of my favorite names.

FREDDY:
Why?

IGOR:
Oh!  May I call you 'Master'?

FREDDY:
He only died two weeks ago  I'm sure they'll still have him. Hurry now.  I'll prepare the body.

IGOR:
I'm getting excited just thinking about it.  What if he's not there?

FREDDY:
Can you imagine that brain in this body?

IGOR:
That's not bad.

FREDDY:
And he wrote seventeen cookbooks.

IGOR:
Hmm!

FREDDY:
Was he any good???  He was the finest natural philosopher, internal medicine diagnostician and chemical therapist of this century.

IGOR:
Was he any good?

FREDDY:
I want that brain.

IGOR:
Yes.  Dr. H. Delbruck.

FREDDY:
Do you have the name I wrote down?

IGOR:
I have a pretty good idea.

FREDDY:
Very little decay.  With this magnificent specimen for a body, all we need now is an equally magnificent brain.  You know what to do!

IGOR:
Could be raining!

FREDDY:
How?

IGOR:
Could be worse!

FREDDY:
What a filthy job!

FREDDY:
Yes, I think we could all use a good laugh.

IGOR:
Taking the book along?

FREDDY:
Funny it should just be lying out here on the table.  I wonder what kind of dribble this is?

IGOR:
'How I Did It.'  Good title!

FREDDY:
It is!  This was my grandfather's private library.  Look at this!

IGOR:
Must be the music room.

FREDDY:
What is this place?

IGOR:
No, but when I first came in, there was a light coming from behind that steel door.

FREDDY:
Did you see anyone else down here?

IGOR:
Two switches over there, but I wasn't going to be the first.

FREDDY:
You didn't hear... nothing! Aren't there any lights in this place?

IGOR:
What?

FREDDY:
It seems that way.  You didn't hear any music at all?

FREDDY:
Did you hear that strange music?

IGOR:
What?

FREDDY:
Did you hear that strange music??

IGOR:
What?

FREDDY:
Did you hear that strange music?

IGOR:
Just putting up some tea.

FREDDY:
But what you were doing?

IGOR:
I got frightened all alone upstairs, so I came down here.

FREDDY:
What are you doing here?

IGOR:
Froderick!

FREDDY:
Ayegor!

FREDDY:
I wonder what's got into them?

IGOR:
Down!  Get down, you beasts!

FREDDY:
Home.

IGOR:
Home!

IGOR:
Go ahead, play dumb!  You'll lose your sockers and then be fockers.

FREDDY:
Wockers with the knockers???

IGOR:
The wockers with the knockers.

FREDDY:
What wockers?

IGOR:
Suit yourself...I'm easy.  Better watch out for the wockers.

FREDDY:
No.

IGOR:
I thought you wanted to.

FREDDY:
Why are you talking like that?

IGOR:
There wolf!  There castle!

FREDDY:
I beg your pardon?

IGOR:
There.

IGOR:
What hump?

FREDDY:
Incidentally  I don't mean to embarrass you in any way, but I'm a rather brilliant surgeon.  Perhaps I can help you with that hump.

FREDDY:
Yes, just the two.

IGOR:
Are these your bags?

FREDDY:
How do you do?

IGOR:
This is Inga.  They thought you might need an assistant temporarily.

FREDDY:
I'm sure we will.

IGOR:
Yes, that's right.  My grandfather and your grandfather used to pal around together.  You and I should have a lot of laughs.

FREDDY:
You were sent by Herr Falkstein, weren't you?

IGOR:
Well, they were wrong then, weren't they?

FREDDY:
But they told me it was Ee gor.

IGOR:
No, it's pronounced Aye gor.

FREDDY:
You must be Igor.

IGOR:
I see.

FREDDY:
It's not.  It's Fredereck Fronkonsteen.

IGOR:
Why isn't it Frodereck Fronkon steen?

FREDDY:
No, Fred ereck.

IGOR:
And do you also say Fro dereck?

FREDDY:
No, it's pronounced Fron kon steen.

IGOR:
Are you putting me on?

FREDDY:
Fron kon steen!

IGOR:
Frederick Frankenstein?

FREDDY:
Don't you think I know that?  But what are you judging by?  Bucharest??? This was always a hick town.  They can't get a 'Bus and Truck' company to come in here.  Are you going to let these idiots get the best of you? ...Or are you going to stand up like a man and show them that you've got more dignity in your little finger than they've got in all their beer bloated bodies put together?

MONSTER:
MMMmmmmmm.

FREDDY:
Wait!  Stop!  Don't give them the satisfaction.  I know it's tough, but look at how far we've come! Are you going to throw it all away now??

MONSTER:
MMMMMMMMMM! MMMMMMMMMMMM!

FREDDY:
For  God's sake  go on!  Are you trying to make me look like a fool. Sing, you amateur!  Sing!!

MONSTER:
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmm!

FREDDY:
...Super duper. Come let's mix where Rock efellers walk with sticks or 'umber ellas' in their mitts.........................

MONSTER:
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmm.

MONSTER:
Soo  pah doo  per.

FREDDY:
Dressed up like a million dollar trouper Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper.

MONSTER:

FREDDY:
Diff'rent types who wear a day coat, pants with stripes and cutaway coat, perfect fits.........................

MONSTER:
Poo  tmmm anngh ma Ritz!

MONSTER:
MMmmm!  MMmmm!

FREDDY:
Get the sedative ready!

MONSTER:
... It's.

FREDDY:
It's alive.  It's  moving! It's  breathing!  It's  standing!  What is your name?

FREDDY:
Yes, I'm going to set you free.  Is the sedative ready?

MONSTER:
MMMmmmm!  MMMmmmm!

FREDDY:
I'm going to untie you  can you understand that?

MONSTER:
MMMmmmmmmmm.

FREDDY:
How's everything?

MONSTER:
MMMMMmmmmmmm.

FREDDY:
Hello there.

FREDDY:
It's alive!

MONSTER:
MMMMMMMMMMMMMNNNNNNmmmmmmmm?!?

OLD VIOLINIST:
Ja, ja.

FREDDY:
Nice!  Nice little balance to it.

FREDDY:
Oh, just a little.

OLD VIOLINIST:
It's an honor for me, sir.  You play the violin?

FREDDY:
May I see your violin?

FREDDY:
How sweet!  Such a quaint little tune.

OLD VIOLINIST:
Zis is an old Transylvanian Lullaby.

FREDDY:
What's that tune that you're playing

FREDDY:
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!

INGA:
Sweetheart.....Is this really you???

INGA:
I love it when you're excited.  Come then, my Apfelstrudel!  Come into my arms and let me hold you.

FREDDY:
MMMMMMmmmmmmmmm!

INGA:
Ready for Fuchsmachen???

FREDDY:
MMMMmmmmm!

INGA:
Are you ready for me?

INGA:
Yes, sweetie...I heard you.  So! I'm ready for you, meine Liebe.

FREDDY:
MMMMmmmmm!

FREDDY:
MMmmm.

INGA:
All right if I turn out the lamp, sweetheart?

FREDDY:
...But an intellectual relationship, like this  we could have as often as we wanted.  Three times a day  anything!

INGA:
Yes, I will.

FREDDY:
You've got to help me to remain faithful.

INGA:
Yes, I know.

FREDDY:
It wouldn't be fair to her.

INGA:
Yes, I know.

FREDDY:
Well...  ... perhaps for a few minutes.

INGA:
Why don't we talk inside?

FREDDY:
Yes...yes, you have yours.

INGA:
And I have mine.

FREDDY:
Yes, I have mine.

INGA:
But, after all, you have yours.

FREDDY:
Yes, Elizabeth has hers.

INGA:
And Elizabeth has hers.

INGA:
We all have our feelings.  I know that I have mine.  And... I wouldn't want to hurt yours.

FREDDY:
No.  Nor to Elizabeth.

INGA:
Nor to Elizabeth.

FREDDY:
I say, it wouldn't be fair to you... or to me.

INGA:
What?

INGA:
Of course not.

FREDDY:
It wouldn't be fair to Elizabeth.

INGA:
I know Frederick.

FREDDY:
There can never... ever... be anything physical between us. You know that, dear.

INGA:
I see what you mean.

FREDDY:
I know, but I mean  not fooling around physically?... Or not fooling around intellectually?

INGA:
Not fooling around.

FREDDY:
It's terrible  the price society demands in the name of fidelity... ultimately?

INGA:
I've missed you intellectually, too, Doctor.

FREDDY:
Oh, a little.  But it's not just physical loneliness.  It's the pangs that come from missing someone intellectually... as I have you.

INGA:
What's wrong, Doctor?  You seem... lonely.

FREDDY:
Just passing through the night.

FREDDY:
Wonderful?  It's terrible! Terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible!

INGA:
Why, doctor...how wonderful for you.

FREDDY:
Good night!

INGA:
Good night, Doctor.

FREDDY:
Good!  It shouldn't take more than a few seconds.

INGA:
I think so.

FREDDY:
Did you do it?

INGA:
Oh!  Yes, Doctor.

FREDDY:
Give him the sedative!

INGA:
Are you serious??

FREDDY:
All right  give it to him!

FREDDY:
Stop  singing!!!

INGA:
It has a passion, 'The Conti nental...'

INGA:
It's something daring, 'The Continental,' A way of dancing that's really ultra new It's very subtle, 'The Continental.'

FREDDY:
This is not the finals  just sing!

INGA:
I'd be so nervous.

FREDDY:
Yes  quickly, dear!

INGA:
Me?  Sing?

FREDDY:
Do you think you can sing it?

FREDDY:
I think I'll...carry him.

INGA:
What are you going to do?

INGA:
What do you think we should do?

FREDDY:
It looks that way.

FREDDY:
Alive!  Look at it.  I have defeated death!

INGA:
I think you've done it, master.

INGA:
Oh, Doctor!

FREDDY:
Look here   if it wasn't you, and it wasn't you, and it wasn't me...

INGA:
It wasn't me.

FREDDY:
I don't understand  I followed the notes to the letter.

INGA:
I thought it was wonderful.

FREDDY:
Reputation.  Reputation!

INGA:
Oh!  Yes, Doctor.

FREDDY:
Raise the platform, hurry!

INGA:
Right here?

FREDDY:
I know.

INGA:
Yes!

FREDDY:
A god?

INGA:
Oh, Frederick... you're not only a great doctor, you're a great... you're almost a...

FREDDY:
Soon, all the electrical secrets of Heaven shall be mine.

FREDDY:
'Dilation of his sacral parasympathetic impulses would cause an increase in flow of blood and the erection to approximately nineteen inches of his apparatus genitals.'

INGA:
And look at this, Doctor!

FREDDY:
'As the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved to make the Creature of a gigantic stature.' Of course!  That would simplify everything.

FREDDY:
Perhaps we'd better leave.

INGA:
Oh, doctor!

INGA:
But who was playing it?

FREDDY:
Well, this explains the music.

INGA:
Look, Doctor!

FREDDY:
What a filthy mess.

INGA:
Ooh!

FREDDY:
All right then, quietly!  Close your robe and stay right behind me. Don't make a sound!

INGA:
Let me come with you, Doctor, please!  I don't want to stay up here alone.

FREDDY:
Whatever it is, it's coming from down there.  I'm going down to see.

INGA:
Dr. Fronkonsteen  look!

FREDDY:
I don't know.  It just woke me up.

INGA:
Yes!  What could it be at this hour?

FREDDY:
Listen!  Don't you hear that strange music?

INGA:
What is it?  Is something wrong, Doctor?

FREDDY:
Inga, wake up!

INGA:
Yes, you may... but don't make any noise.

FREDDY:
Inga!

FREDDY:
Well... I'll just finish unpacking.

INGA:
No, thanks!  I want to get right to sleep.

FREDDY:
Would you like a sandwich?

FREDDY:
Well.. I suppose it would be all right, for just a little while.

INGA:
Oh please  just till I get sleepy. Then you can force me right back to my room.

FREDDY:
Well...

INGA:
I know, but usually I can fall asleep right away.  It must be the strange room.

FREDDY:
We only arrived a few minutes ago.

INGA:
Could I lie down in your bed for a little while?  I just can't sleep.

FREDDY:
That's quite all right.  What is it, dear?

INGA:
Are you busy?

FREDDY:
Just an atmospheric discharge. Nothing to be afraid of.

INGA:
Sometimes I'm afraid of the lightning.

FREDDY:
I'm not sure I...get your drift.

INGA:
Did you ever have a roll in the hay?

FREDDY:
Yes, thank you.  It wasn't bad.

INGA:
Did you have a pleasant trip?

FREDDY:
How nice.

INGA:
Extremely well.

INGA:
Do Something!  Stall them!

IGOR:
Another fifteen seconds to go.

INGA:
Igor  the clock!  Hurry!

IGOR:
Oh, must be around ten... tenthirty.

IGOR:
Sounds like visitors.  It's all right  Frau Blucher will show them in.

m615:
INGA 

IGOR:
Absolutely!  May my mother grow two heads if I'm not telling the truth.

INGA:
Igor  are you sure the monster has a good brain?  Are you absolutely certain that you took the brain of Hans Delbruck that night?

INGA:
Oh, Igor  I'm so afraid!  I just hope this all ends well.

IGOR:
What d'ya want to do to kill time?

INGA:
Yes.

IGOR:
Three minutes to go!

INGA:
Four

IGOR:
How long is it so far?

INGA:
The doctor said to allow seven minutes  no more and no less  or else they could both become hopelessly paralyzed.

IGOR:
How do you know they're done?

IGOR:
Why certainly.  Don't you, Frau Blucher?

INGA:
I think the doctor is a genius! Don't you, Igor?

IGOR:
You can't expect to iron out all the kinks in one night.

INGA:
Look how far we've come.

IGOR:
Why don't we all turn in?  It's been a long day.

INGA:
I'm getting tired.

IGOR:
Do you know the theme from 'Doctor Zhivago'?

INGA:
It's working!  Oh, Doctor  you play beautifully.

IGOR:
Whew!  A nineteeninch drill.

INGA:
His schwanzstucker.

IGOR:
His what??

INGA:
There must have been someone else down here then.

IGOR:
No, not sound.

MAITRE D':
Franz!  Help!  Lunatic!

MONSTER:
GRRRHMMNNNJKJMMMNN!

MAITRE D':
Now just one moment.  There's no need for roughhousing.  Have you ever tried a tip?

MONSTER:
Foooooood!

MAITRE D':
Oh, no siree.  If yo don't have a reservation you can skip to maloo.

MONSTER:
Drink!

MAITRE D':
I'm sorry, sir.  We only seat by reservation.

MONSTER:
Food!!

MAITRE D':
Do you have a reservation?

MONSTER:
Food!

MAITRE D':
Yes, sir, name, please?

TRUMAN:
It doesn't matter.  I'll make other arrangements.

AGENT:
You want to book the flight?

TRUMAN:
That's right.

AGENT:
I thought you were in a hurry.

TRUMAN:
Why wouldn't I?

AGENT:
I do have a fabulous rate on a cruise ship departing for Fiji tomorrow.  But you wouldn't want to do that.

TRUMAN:
You are a travel agent, aren't you?  Doris?  Your job is to help people travel.

AGENT:
It's the busy season.

TRUMAN:
iA month.i

AGENT:
I'm sorry.  I don't have anything for at least a month.

TRUMAN:
Today.

AGENT:
When do you want to leave, remembering, of course, you do lose a day on the way there?

TRUMAN:
One.

AGENT:
Viti Levu.  For how many?

TRUMAN:
I'm sorry, er...the biggest one.

AGENT:
iWherei in Fiji?  What island?

TRUMAN:
iFiji.i

AGENT:
Where exactly?

TRUMAN:
I want to book a flight to Fiji.

AGENT:
I'm sorry to keep you.  How can I help?

CHRISTOF:
Do it!

SIMEON:
He doesn't care.

CHRISTOF:
iStormi music...Wagner...

SIMEON:
What music?

CHRISTOF:
Cue music...

CHRISTOF:
Sweep the harbor.

SIMEON:
Why would we

CHRISTOF:
We're not watching the sea.

SIMEON:
It's just a matter of time.

CHRISTOF:
What have we missed?

SIMEON:
I'm sure we'll get him on this next sweep.

SIMEON:
He has to be on foot.  He has the world's most recognizable face.  He can't disappear.

CHRISTOF:
All prop cars accounted for?

SIMEON:
We've declared a curfew.  Everyone else is at first positions.

SIMEON:
He gave it back to his father.

CHRISTOF:
Give me a shot from Truman's ring.

SIMEON:
He was tidying up his garbage.  I was going to call you.  But halfway through, he gave up and fell asleep.

CHRISTOF:
What happened down there?

CHRISTOF:
What's on the ClockCam?

SIMEON:
What's to see?

CHRISTOF:
Why wasn't I told?  Any unpredictable behavior has to be reported.  Is that the best shot we can get?

SIMEON:
He moved down there after Meryl packed up and left.

CHRISTOF:
Why is he in the basement?

CHRISTOF:
No, hold back...

SIMEON:
Close up?

INTERVIEWER:
Let's take another call.  London, England, you're on Tru Talk.

CHRISTOF:
We've learnt about life as Truman has and, despite the complaints of a minority, it's been an overwhelmingly positive experience, for Truman and for the viewing public.

INTERVIEWER:
The Hague for Christof...The Hague?...lost them.  Hollywood, California, you're on Tru Talk.

CHRISTOF:
I've been tempted.  But I think it's important to retain objectivity.  I wouldn't want to get emotionally caught up.

INTERVIEWER:
You've never actually met Truman, yourself.  Never thought about doing a cameoplaying a veterinarian, or a priest, something like that?

CHRISTOF:
We accept the reality of the world with which we're presented.  As the show expanded, naturally we were forced to manufacture ways to keep Truman in Seahaven  demonstrating that every venture is accompanied by a risk.

INTERVIEWER:
Why do you feel that Truman's never come close to discovering the true nature of his world?

INTERVIEWER:
And it's all available in the Truman Show catalogue.  Operators are standing by.

CHRISTOF:
There's nothing on the show I don't use myself.

INTERVIEWER:
All products carefully chosen and tested by you for quality and aesthetic value.

CHRISTOF:
Yes, everything you see on the show is for sale  from the actors' wardrobe, food products, to the very homes they live in

INTERVIEWER:
No, of course not.  And since the show runs 24 hours a day with no commercial breaks the staggering profits are all generated from product placement.

CHRISTOF:
People forget it takes the ipopulationi of an entire country to keep the show running.

INTERVIEWER:
And the show now generates a yearly income equivalent to the gross national product of a small country.

CHRISTOF:
That's correct.

INTERVIEWER:
Who knew that a show originally meant to last one year  Bringing Up Baby  would turn into a cradle to grave concept.  He is in fact the first child in the world to be legally adopted by a corporation.

CHRISTOF:
In competition with five other unwanted pregnancies  the casting of a show determined by an air date  he was the one who arrived on cue.

INTERVIEWER:
Of course, his eagerness to leave his mother's womb also meant he was the one selected.

CHRISTOF:
He was curious from birth  premature by two weeks, as if he couldn't wait to get started.

CHRISTOF:
Let me demonstrate some examples.

INTERVIEWER:
We should remind viewers that Truman, especially as a child, presented a challenge for the production.

INTERVIEWER:
Istanbul, Turkey, you're on with master videographer, Christof.

CHRISTOF:
As with our own lives, the only people he can't cast are his family.  Otherwise he has final approval, able to elevate an extra into a lead role as was the case with his only real friend, Marlon, or alternatively relegate a star to a bit player.

INTERVIEWER:
Of course, Truman has always been very much in on casting.

CHRISTOF:
Certainly a nomination.

INTERVIEWER:
Are we talking Emmies?

INTERVIEWER:
Let's go to some of those viewers' calls.

CHRISTOF:
We find many viewers leave him on all night for comfort.  Haven't you ever watched your child or your lover sleep?

INTERVIEWER:
But how do you account for the popularity of those eight hours a day when Truman sleeps?

CHRISTOF:
Not only does he give us a glimpse of the truth, he gives us a glimpse of ourselves.

CHRISTOF:
I prefer to think of it as a mirror.

INTERVIEWER:
A window onto the human condition?

CHRISTOF:
We've become tired of watching actors give us phony emotions, bored with pyrotechnics and special effects.  While the world he inhabits is counterfeit, there's nothing fake about Truman himself.  No scripts, no cue cards.  It's not always Shakespeare but it's genuine.  That's how he can support an entire channel.

CHRISTOF:
It has to be the reality.

INTERVIEWER:
But recent events have been so dramatic, it does raise the perennial question. What keeps us watching this one man twentyfour hours a day  eating, sleeping, working, sitting for hours in contemplation?

CHRISTOF:
As you know ratings have never been our primary goal.  I imagine we'll lose those voyeurs only interested in witnessing Truman's latest torment.  However, I'm certain that our core audience will remain loyal.

INTERVIEWER:
Let's talk ratings.  Truman has always enjoyed top ten status but the huge surge over the last few dayshow do you hope to sustain that audience now that Truman appears to have reconciled himself?

INTERVIEWER:
Of course.

CHRISTOF:
Amnesia.

INTERVIEWER:
How idoi you intend to explain his twenty two year absence?

CHRISTOF:
That and a fat, new contract.

INTERVIEWER:
I understand he's hardly had a life of his own since he left the show.  How did you convince himwas it the opportunity to be close to Truman again?

CHRISTOF:
Since Kirk started this whole crisis in Truman's life, I came to the conclusion that he was the only one who could end it.

INTERVIEWER:
and certainly the first time that an intruder has been rewarded with a starring role.  I really must congratulate you on writing Kirk back in.  A master stroke.

CHRISTOF:
a dead one at that.

INTERVIEWER:
Of course, there hasn't been anything to compare with this  the first time an intruder has been a former cast member

CHRISTOF:
We ihavei had our close calls in the past.

INTERVIEWER:
The catalyst for the recent dramatic events was of course Truman's father, Kirk, and his infiltration onto the show. Before we discuss that, it's worth reminding viewers that this isn't the first time someone from the outside world has tried to reach Truman.

CHRISTOF:
Thank you.

INTERVIEWER:
Welcome.

TRUMAN:
You never had a camera in my head.

CHRISTOF:
Truman, I've watched you your whole life. I saw you take your first step, your first word, your first kiss.  I know you better than you know yourself.  You're not going to walk out that door

TRUMAN:
I have a map.

CHRISTOF:
iYoui were real.  That's what made you you so good to watch.

TRUMAN:
Nothing was real.

CHRISTOF:
You're the star.

TRUMAN:
iA show.i  Then who am I?

CHRISTOF:
A show  that gives hope and joy and inspiration to millions.

TRUMAN:
The creator of what?

CHRISTOF:
I'm the creator.

TRUMAN:
Who are you?

DAUGHTER:
I can't believe he married Meryl on the rebound.

MOTHER:
Because his mother got sick  very sick.  He couldn't leave her.  He's a kind boy, maybe too kind.

DAUGHTER:
But why didn't he just follow her to Fiji?

MOTHER:
Shhh!

DAUGHTER:
The memory of who?

MOTHER:
They removed all physical trace of her but they couldn't erase the memory.

DAUGHTER:
What's he doing?

GUARD 2:
Guess I always thought they'd adopt.

GUARD 1:
Sure she would.

GUARD 2:
You think she'd go through with it?

GUARD 1:
Why not?

GUARD 2:
It's not gonna be his, you idiot.

GUARD 1:
How can they have a child?

TRUMAN:
I...I can't.

LAUREN:
It's beautiful!  What are you waiting for?

TRUMAN:
I think I've studied enough.

LAUREN:
Well, what do you want to do?

LAUREN:
If we don't go now, it won't happen.

TRUMAN:
Right now?  We've got finals tomorrow.

LAUREN:
Now.

TRUMAN:
Actually, I'm free Sunday.

TRUMAN:
Saturday?

LAUREN:
No.

TRUMAN:
No?  Really?  Good, I mean, I thought possibly a pizza.  How about Friday?

LAUREN:
No...I, er.

TRUMAN:
You have a boyfriend?  Of course you do.

LAUREN:
I'm sorry.  It's not up to me.

TRUMAN:
It's okay.  I probably wouldn't talk to me either.

LAUREN:
I'm not allowed to talk to you.

TRUMAN:
I'm Truman, Truman Burbank

LAUREN:
That's right.  Lauren.

TRUMAN:
Lauren, right?

LAUREN:
Oh, yes.

TRUMAN:
You take Japanese.

MARLON:
The thing that started all of this.

TRUMAN:
What's that?

MARLON:
Not the whole thing, Truman.  You were right about one thing.

TRUMAN:
So what are you saying, Marlon, the whole thing has been in my head?

MARLON:
And the last thing I'd ever do is lie to you.  Think about it, Truman, if everybody's in on it, I'd have to be in on it too. I'm not in on it, because there is no iit.i

TRUMAN:
This is different.  Everybody seems to be in on it.

MARLON:
It's a lot of world for one man.  You sure that's not wishful thinking, you wishing you'd made something more of yourself? Christ, Truman, who hasn't sat on the John and had an imaginary interview on Seahaven Tonight?  Who hasn't wanted to be somebody?

TRUMAN:
I don't know what to think, Marlon. Maybe I'm going out of my mind, but I get the feeling that the world revolves around me somehow.

MARLON:
Truman?  It's me, Marlon.  I need to talk to you.

TRUMAN:
Stay where you are!

MARLON:
Really?

TRUMAN:
Just between you and me, Marlon, I'm going away for a while.

MARLON:
That's the Big Guy.  Quite a paintbrush he's got.

TRUMAN:
Yeah...

MARLON:
I went all over but I never found a place like this.  Look at that sunset, Truman.  It's perfect.

TRUMAN:
When you were hauling chickens for Kaiser Poultry, what was the furthest you ever went off the island?

MARLON:
No.

TRUMAN:
Things.  Things that doesn't fit.  Maybe I'm being set up for something. You ever feel like that, Marlon?  Like your whole life has been building to something?

MARLON:
What exactly?

TRUMAN:
This is where it started.

MARLON:
What're we doing here, Truman?

TRUMAN:
I've got to show you something.

MARLON:
I told you I can't.

TRUMAN:
Could be.  Beard looks phony.  It's when I'm unpredictable.  They can't stand that.  That's why we've got to get out of here.  Can you come with me?

MARLON:
How about them?

TRUMAN:
It's hard to tell.  They look just like regular people.

MARLON:
Who?

TRUMAN:
I think he's alive.  I'll tell you about it later.  I'm definitely being followed.

MARLON:
Your Dad?!

TRUMAN:
I think it's got something to do with my dad.

MARLON:
No.  Truman, if this is another one of your fantasies...

TRUMAN:
There's no point in trying to explain it, but a lot of strange things have been happening  elevators that don't go anywhere, people talking about me on the radio, you know what I mean?

MARLON:
iMixed up?i  Mixed up in what?

TRUMAN:
I think I'm mixed up in something.

MARLON:
Are you okay?  You look like shit.

TRUMAN:
I'm onto something, Marlon  something big.

MARLON:
Sorry, I'm way behind.

TRUMAN:
I've got to talk to you.

MARLON:
Truman, what are you doing here?

TRUMAN:
Marlon

TRUMAN:
I can't tonight.

MARLON:
Sure.  It's halogen.  Shame it didn't hit you  you could've sued.  You coming for a drink?

TRUMAN:
You really think it could've dropped off an airliner?

MARLON:
Trust me.

TRUMAN:
You think so?

MARLON:
I figured, what's the point?  I knew I'd just be taking my problems with me.  Once the kids came along, it made me look at Seahaven with new eyes.  I realized, what the hell could be better than this?  I'm telling you.  What you really need is someone to carry on the Burbank name.

TRUMAN:
Yeah, what happened?

MARLON:
Truman, you know, I did think about moving away one time.

TRUMAN:
iSpare roomi  I can start thinking about selling up...and I'll be gone.  Up and away on that big steel bird.  I'm going, don't you worry about that.

MARLON:
Nursery?

TRUMAN:
It's not that simple.  Takes money, planning.  You can't just up and go.  Oh, I'm going to do it, don't worry about that.  I've just got to move slow.  Pick my moment.  Bonus time's just around the corner.  Soon as I finish the...

MARLON:
So when are you leaving?

TRUMAN:
See here, this is us.  All the way round here, Fiji.  You can't get any further away before you start coming back.  Y'know, there are still islands in Fiji where no human has ever set foot.

TRUMAN:
Outta my job, outta Seahaven, off this island...iout!i

MARLON:
Yeah?  Outta what?

TRUMAN:
I'm thinking of getting out, Marlon.

MERYL:
Truman, you're gonna be late!

TRUMAN:
What are my plans now?  Well, next I'm thinking of tackling the Yuba River in an authentic canoe from the Algonquin tribe. I'm talking about the north fork, a class five rapid  only I'm not going idowni the Yuba, I'm going iup.i  Do you honestly think for one minute I'd go back to some dreary office to rubber stamp meaningless documents...do you?

MERYL:
Truman, stop it!

TRUMAN:
No.  You said, Do something.  Who were you talking to?  Tell me!

MERYL:
You're the one talking to the walls!

TRUMAN:
Who were you talking to?!

MERYL:
Do something...

TRUMAN:
Stop this now.  I'll do it.  I swear.

TRUMAN:
You're part of this, aren't you?!

MERYL:
You're having a nervous breakdown, that's what's happening.

TRUMAN:
What the hell has that got to do with anything?  Tell me what's happening?!

MERYL:
I've tasted other cocoas.  This is the best.

TRUMAN:
What the hell are you talking about?!

MERYL:
Why don't I make you some of this new Mococoa Drink?  All natural.  Cocoa beans from the upper slopes of Mount Nicaragua. No artificial sweeteners

MERYL:
That's not true.

TRUMAN:
Why do you want to have a child with me? You can't stand me.

MERYL:
Let me get you some help, Truman.  You're not well.

MERYL:
So we just eat into our savings, is that the idea?  I'd better call your mother when we get there.  She'll be worried sick  I don't know how she's going to take this.

TRUMAN:
I've got my Seahaven Bankcard.

MERYL:
So what do we do for money when we get to New Orleans?

TRUMAN:
I'm sure they're just exaggerating.

MERYL:
Truman, what about that sign?

TRUMAN:
I bet you did.

MERYL:
Truman, I took the hypocrite oath!

TRUMAN:
Uhuh.  There's no accident.  It's just more stalling.

MERYL:
There's been an accident, Truman.

TRUMAN:
It's hard to go places, isn't it?

TRUMAN:
I think I'd like a little company.

MERYL:
Let me out, Truman.  You're not right in the head.  You want to destroy yourself, you do it on your own!

TRUMAN:
I've changed my mind again.  What's New Orleans like this time of year?  Mardi Gras.  Or let's just see where the road takes us.

MERYL:
Truman, that was our house!

TRUMAN:
Should I?

MERYL:
You blaming me for the traffic?

TRUMAN:
Blocked at every turn.  Beautifully synchronized, don't you agree?

MERYL:
Truman, I think I'm going to throw up.

TRUMAN:
Because I never have.  That's why you go places, isn't it?

MERYL:
So why do you want to go?

TRUMAN:
That's right.  I do, don't I?

MERYL:
You hate gambling.

TRUMAN:
Where shall we go?  Where shall we go? Spontaneity is what it's all about. Forget Fiji.  We can't very well drive to Fiji, can we?  What about Atlantic City?

MERYL:
What?!

TRUMAN:
Let's go now.

MERYL:
You're upset because you want to go to Fiji.  Is that it?

TRUMAN:
Are you listening to a word I'm saying?

MERYL:
we need more charcoal.

TRUMAN:
I won't be here Sunday.

MERYL:
I invited Marlon and Rita for a barbeque Sunday.  I thought I'd make my potato salad.  Remind me

MERYL:
Put some butter on itor ice?

TRUMAN:
you're a nurse, aren't you?

MERYL:
I don't know

TRUMAN:
What do I do?

MERYL:
Oh, my God!

TRUMAN:
Arrah!

MERYL:
Surgery.  The elevator disaster downtown on the news last night.  Cable snapped, a car dropped ten floors.  Nonunion contractors.  Monsters.  We're starting with an amputation.

TRUMAN:
What's the hurry?

MERYL:
I'm sorry, I'm late.

TRUMAN:
I have to talk with you.  But not here.  Let's go for a walk.

MERYL:
See you in a minute, sweetheart.

TRUMAN:
Good night, Mother.

MERYL:
I'll take you home, Angela.  Why don't you leave those with us for a while?

TRUMAN:
I still want to look over a couple of things.

MERYL:
Come on, Truman.  Haven't you studied enough?

TRUMAN:
I'm not hungry.

MERYL:
I made macaroni.

TRUMAN:
What did you want?

MERYL:
Your mother called.  You shouldn't upset her like that.

TRUMAN:
How do you know?

MERYL:
I know.

TRUMAN:
Fixing the mower.  I saw my father today.

MERYL:
What're you doing down here?

TRUMAN:
I think I'm going to stay up for a while.

MERYL:
This'll pass.  Everybody thinks like this now and then.  Come to bed.

TRUMAN:
That can wait.  I want to get away.  See some of the world.  Explore.

MERYL:
I thought we were going to try for a baby.  Isn't that enough of an adventure?

TRUMAN:
It'd be an adventure.

MERYL:
We're mortgaged to the eyeballs, Truman. There's the car payments.  Are we just going to walk away from our financial obligations?

TRUMAN:
Maybe I feel like a teenager.

MERYL:
And then what, Truman?  We'd be back to where we were five years ago.  You're talking like a teenager.

TRUMAN:
We could bum around the world for a year on that.

MERYL:
Every time you and Marlon

TRUMAN:
I figure we could scrape together eight thousand.

MERYL:
Oh, God.

TRUMAN:
I've been thinking

MERYL:
Where have you been?

MERYL:
Did something happen today?

TRUMAN:
I won't be late.

MERYL:
I was hoping we could have a special evening.

MERYL:
A man tripped and fell on a chainsaw.  We got three of his fingers back on.

TRUMAN:
How did it go today?

TRUMAN:
Gee, that's great.

MERYL:
Hi, honey.  Look at this.  It's a Chef'sMate.  Dicer, slicer and peeler in one.  Never needs sharpening. Dishwasher safe.

TRUMAN:
They're...  perfect.  Thank you.

MERYL:
Well, what do you think?

MERYL:
It's a surprise.

TRUMAN:
What's that?

MERYL:
Truman, you're gonna be late!

TRUMAN:
...personally I think the unconquered south face is the only one worth scaling...of course it's a 20,000 foot sheer wall of ice but then when did that ever stop me before?...Naturally, I intend to make the ascent without the benefit of oxygen but also without crampons or even an ice pick...irisks?i...  ...sure I'm aware of the riskswhy else do you think I would spend seven years as an adjuster in a life insurance company...?

MOTHER:
Things always dowhen you look back.

TRUMAN:
It looks so small.

MOTHER:
Hold on a minute, dear.  Here's us at Mount Rushmore.  You remember, Trumanwhen Dad was still with us  that was quite a drive.  You slept all the way there.

TRUMAN:
We ought to be getting you back, Mother.

MOTHER:
You know he was an only child, like you.  I know how bad you feel about what happenedsailing into that storm.  But I don't blame you, Truman.  I never have.

TRUMAN:
I'm telling you, if it wasn't him, it was his twin.  Did Dad have a brother?

MOTHER:
Darling

TRUMAN:
They never found Dad's bodymaybe somehow

MOTHER:
About time they started cleaning up the trash Downtown.  We don't want to end up like the rest of the country.

TRUMAN:
It was Dad, I swear, dressed like a homeless man.  And you know what else was really strange?  A businessman and a woman with a little dog appeared from nowhere and forced him onto a bus.

MOTHER:
It doesn't sound insane, Truman.  I swear I see him ten times a weekin a hundred faces.  I almost hugged a perfect stranger in the salon last Thursday.

MOTHER:
I feel certain my condition runs in the family.  Can't this wait, dear?

TRUMAN:
I spend half my life out in the sun, Mother, why would I need vitamin D?

MOTHER:
You look very pale, Truman.  Are you taking your vitamin D's?

TRUMAN:
I've got something to tell you.  You'd better sit down.

MOTHER:
You know surprises aren't good for me. You should really call before you come over, dear.

MOTHER:
Oh, just so.

TRUMAN:
How's your hip?

MOTHER:
Well, I made it through another night.

TRUMAN:
How are you, Mother?

NURSE:
Fine.  I'll tell her.

TRUMAN:
You got it.

NURSE:
When you get to Fiji?

TRUMAN:
Tell her, tell her...I had to go to Fiji. I'll call her when I get there.

NURSE:
I'll try.

TRUMAN:
Sure.  Okay.  Fine.  Can you pass on a message?

NURSE:
I'm afraid that's impossibleshe's in preop.

TRUMAN:
I'm looking for my wifeNurse Burbank. It's important.

OFFICER:
You're welcome, Truman.

TRUMAN:
Well, thank you for your help.

OFFICER:
The whole area's being evacuated.

TRUMAN:
Is there any way around?

OFFICER:
Leak at the plant.  They had to shut her down.

TRUMAN:
Now what?

SYLVIA:
You must listen.  Everybody's pretending, Truman.

TRUMAN:
I don't understand.

SYLVIA:
It doesn't matter.  Everybody knows about it.  They know everything you do. The point is, you got scared.

TRUMAN:
Were you therehow do you know?

SYLVIA:
And your teacher said, You're too late, Truman.  There's nothing left to explore.

TRUMAN:
How do you know about that?

SYLVIA:
Just listen.  You remember when you were a little boy, you stood up in class and said you wanted to be an explorer like Magellan

TRUMAN:
There's no one here.

SYLVIA:
They're going to stop me talking to you.

TRUMAN:
Who?

SYLVIA:
They're coming.  Any minute.

TRUMAN:
You can count on it.

TYRONE:
See you tomorrow, Truman.

TYRONE:
I'd ask for identification.

TRUMAN:
Tyrone, what if I said I didn't want meatball today?

TYRONE:
Good.  Good.

TRUMAN:
Not bad.  I just won the State Lottery.

TYRONE:
How's it going, Truman?

JIM CUNNINGHAM:
Now that's what I like to hear!  Because too many young men and women today are paralysed by their fears. They give in to their feelings of selfdoubt... they surrender their bodies to the temptations of drugs, alcohol and premarital sex. Empty solutions. These are toxic chemicals... and diseasespreading behaviour.

AUDIENCE:
GOOD MORNING!

JIM CUNNINGHAM:
Are you AFRAID?

AUDIENCE:
GOOD MORNING!

JIM CUNNINGHAM:
Now that's better... but I still sense some students out there... who are AFRAID... just to say GOOD MORNING!

AUDIENCE:
Good MORNING!

JIM CUNNINGHAM:
That's all the gusta you can musta? I said, Good morning!

AUDIENCE:
Good morning...

JIM CUNNINGHAM:
Good morning, mongrels!

DAVID:
Did you know him?

GRETCHEN:
Yeah.

DAVID:
I feel bad for his family.

DAVID:
Donnie. Donnie Darko.

GRETCHEN:
What was his name?

DAVID:
He got smooshed. By a jet engine.

GRETCHEN:
What happened?

DAVID:
Horrible accident. My neighbour... he got killed.

GRETCHEN:
Hi... what's going on here?

DR. MONNITOFF:
Donnie, I'm afraid I can't continue this conversation. I could lose my job.

DONNIE:
Not if you chose to stay within God's channel...

DR. MONNITOFF:
You are contradicting yourself, Donnie. If we could see our destines manifest themselves visually... then we would be given the choice to betray our chosen destinies. The very fact that this choice exists... would mean that all preformed destiny would end.

DONNIE:
If you could see your path or channel growing out of your stomach, you could see into the future. And that's a form of time travel, right?

DR. MONNITOFF:
I'm not following you.

DONNIE:
If God controls time... then all time is predecided. Then every living thing travels along a set path.

DR. MONNITOFF:
That... is highly unlikely. You're talking about an act of God.

DONNIE:
Could these wormholes appear in nature?

DR. MONNITOFF:
Uhh... sure. And in order for the vessel to travel through time it must find the portal, in this case the wormhole, or some unforeseen portal that lies undiscovered.

DONNIE:
Like a spear that comes out of your stomach?

DR. MONNITOFF:
Beg pardon?

DONNIE:
Like a spear.

DR. MONNITOFF:
Each vessel travels along a vector path through spacetime... along its centre of gravity.

DR. MONNITOFF:
Did you stop and think that maybe infants need darkness? That darkness is part of their natural development.

DONNIE:
Well... the thing is, nobody remembers their infancy. And anyone who says they do is lying. We think that this would help develop memory earlier in life.

DR. MONNITOFF:
What effect do you think this would have on an infant?

DR. MONNITOFF:
A metal craft of any kind.

DONNIE:
Like a DeLorean.

DR. MONNITOFF:
The basic principles of time travel are there.  So you have the vessel and the portal. And the vessel can be anything. Most likely a spacecraft.

DONNIE:
So... that's it?

DR. MONNITOFF:
A wormhole with an EinsteinRosen bridge, which is, theoretically... a wormhole in space controlled by man.

DONNIE:
 and be able to find one of these wormholes.

DR. MONNITOFF:
Theoretically.

DONNIE:
So... in order to travel back in time, you'd have to have a big spaceship or something that can travel faster than the speed of light 

DR. MONNITOFF:
So... according to Hawking... wormholes might be able to provide a short cut for jumping between two distant regions of spacetime.

DONNIE:
I know that this is gonna sound kinda weird... but do you know anything about time travel?

DR. MONNITOFF:
Donnie.

DONNIE:
Dr. Monnitoff?

SAMANTHA:
Donnie! Give it back!

DONNIE:
The Last Unicorn! By Samantha Darko.

SAMANTHA:
You'll put Ariel in the garbage disposal.

DONNIE:
What happens if you tell Mom and Dad about this, Samantha?

SAMANTHA:
I'm telling Mom.

DONNIE:
When you fall asleep tonight, I'm gonna fart in your face.

SAMANTHA:
Why do I have to sleep with Donnie? He stinks.

DONNIE:
Not until like... eighth grade.

SAMANTHA:
When can I squeeze one out?

DONNIE:
Our saviour...

SETH:
What did you say?

DONNIE:
Dea ex machina...

SETH:
You know what? I think that you did it.

DONNIE:
Well, if you're innocent, then you have nothing to worry about.

SETH:
That's not what I heard. Now they think I did it.

DONNIE:
I didn't say shit.

SETH:
Did you tell them that I flooded the school?

FRANK:
You should already know that.  Watch the movie, Donnie. I have something to show you.

DONNIE:
How much longer is this gonna last?

FRANK:
It is the name of my father... and his father before me.

DONNIE:
Why do they call you Frank?

FRANK:
I am so sorry.

DONNIE:
What happened to your eye?

DONNIE:
Take it off. I want to see you.

FRANK:
Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?

DONNIE:
Yeah. Tell me why you're wearing that stupid bunny suit.

FRANK:
You have a request?

DONNIE:
You have to do something for me first.

FRANK:
I want to show you something.

FRANK:
Do you believe in time travel, Donnie?

DONNIE:
Where did you come from?

FRANK:
You'll know soon enough.

DONNIE:
Who is... we?

FRANK:
We just want to guide you in the right direction.

DONNIE:
Why did you make me flood the school?

FRANK:
I can do anything I want... and so can you...

DONNIE:
How can you do that?

DONNIE:
Go home. Go home and tell your parents that everything is going to be just fine.

RONALD:
What'd you do, Donnie? What'd you do!

DONNIE:
A hundred and one, I think. Every day she does the same thing. But there's never any mail.

RONALD:
How old is Grandma Death?

DONNIE:
I don't wanna talk about it.

RONALD:
My dad said he found you on the golf course. Are you sleepwalking again?

DONNIE:
We went to a hotel.

RONALD:
DARKO CHEATS DEATH! Man... you're famous! I called you, like, a jillion times last night!

DONNIE:
Yeah...

GRETCHEN:
Is that a cellar door?

GRETCHEN:
Who's Frank?

DONNIE:
No. Frank.

GRETCHEN:
Why? Is this about the book?

DONNIE:
Time is running out. We have to go see Grandma Death. We have to talk to her.

GRETCHEN:
Where are we going?

DONNIE:
Come with me.

DONNIE:
There's something you have to know, Gretchen.  Everything is going to be just fine.

GRETCHEN:
What?

DONNIE:
It's safe here.

GRETCHEN:
I'm so scared... I just keep thinking that something awful has happened. It's my fucking stepdad. I know it.

GRETCHEN:
Yeah, they told me to get out of the house.

DONNIE:
Did you call the cops?

DONNIE:
But you're OK?

GRETCHEN:
I don't know. She didn't leave a note. The house is all messed up.

DONNIE:
Where is she?

GRETCHEN:
My mom is gone.

DONNIE:
Hey. You OK?

GRETCHEN:
Hey.

DONNIE:
Then when? I have to talk to you.

GRETCHEN:
Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time.

DONNIE:
Will you please talk to me?

DONNIE:
What do you mean?

GRETCHEN:
What's wrong with you?

DONNIE:
You want to skip fourth period and go to the Ridge?

DONNIE:
The whole movie. Let's go.

GRETCHEN:
What? How long was I asleep?

GRETCHEN:
And inside these glasses are these slide photographs. And each photograph is of something peaceful... or beautiful. Whatever pictures the parent wants to put inside.

DONNIE:
Yeah. So the idea is that... you buy these glasses for your infant, and they wear them at night when they sleep.

GRETCHEN:
Infant Memory Generators.

DONNIE:
So, we call them... IMGs.

GRETCHEN:
Maybe she's asleep.

DONNIE:
I know she's here. She never leaves the house.

DONNIE:
She wrote it.  There are chapters in this book that describe the stuff I've been seeing. It can't just be a coincidence.  Will you come see her with me?

GRETCHEN:
Oh, yeah.  The Philosophy of Time Travel. What is this?

DONNIE:
The old crazy woman who lives off Old Gun Road.

GRETCHEN:
Who?

DONNIE:
I've been seeing stuff... a lot of really messedup stuff.  Do you know who Grandma Death is?

GRETCHEN:
Are you okay?

DONNIE:
They suspended me for two days.

GRETCHEN:
What?

DONNIE:
We're moving through time.

GRETCHEN:
Yeah. And right now there's some fat guy over there watching us.

DONNIE:
I always wanted it to be at a time when... when it reminds you how beautiful the world can be.

GRETCHEN:
No... Donnie, wait. I've never...

DONNIE:
That's alright... I understand.

GRETCHEN:
You want to kiss me...

DONNIE:
Well...

GRETCHEN:
And what?

DONNIE:
You know... we've been going together for a week and a half...

GRETCHEN:
Like... a Hawaiian sunset... the Grand Canyon. Things that remind you how beautiful the world can be.

DONNIE:
With, like, images?

GRETCHEN:
That's not good enough. You've got to go back in time and take all those hours of darkness and pain and replace them... with whatever you wanted.

DONNIE:
Why not just buy your baby a night light?

GRETCHEN:
Babies cry because they're afraid of the dark. And because they have no memories... for all they know... every night could be the last forever. Like, perpetual darkness.

DONNIE:
I don't want to talk about it.  So what happened to your neck?

GRETCHEN:
What happened to your neck?

GRETCHEN:
Well... maybe someone is, like... giving you these dream steroids. And sleepwalking ...is someone showing you the way.

DONNIE:
Why?

GRETCHEN:
Do you ever feel as though there's always someone watching you?

DONNIE:
Yeah?

GRETCHEN:
Donnie?

GRETCHEN:
And you'd never been there before?

DONNIE:
No. Every time I wake up somewhere different. Sometimes my bike is laying there next to me. Like once when I woke up on the edge of this cliff up on Carpathian Ridge.

GRETCHEN:
So when you sleepwalk, you go somewhere familiar?

DONNIE:
It's like this big force... that's in your brain. But sometimes it grows bigger... and it spread down into your arms and legs... and it just sends you someplace.

GRETCHEN:
My dad said never wake a sleepwalker... because they could drop dead.

DONNIE:
No. I just wake up and I look around, try to figure out where I am... how I got there.

GRETCHEN:
So when you sleepwalk, can you remember afterward? Like, do you dream?

GRETCHEN:
I'm going home.

DONNIE:
Where are you going?

GRETCHEN:
Sure.

DONNIE:
No... I mean, will you GO with me? That's like... what they call it here. Going together.

GRETCHEN:
Where are we going?

DONNIE:
Will you go with me?

GRETCHEN:
That was a compliment.

DONNIE:
I'm sorry.

GRETCHEN:
You're weird.

DONNIE:
We never would have had this conversation.

GRETCHEN:
Why is that?

DONNIE:
It's a good thing the school was flooded today.

GRETCHEN:
Until it withers away.

DONNIE:
The best thing about soap is that it's the only thing on earth that can never get dirty. No matter what crap you throw on it... it always rubs off. And there it is again... perfect.

GRETCHEN:
Wonder where we'll be then.

DONNIE:
Don't knock soap. Without it, disease would spread rapidly. If we ran out... you and I would never live to see the year 2000.

GRETCHEN:
You mean soap?

DONNIE:
I mean, the whole sanitation thing. Joseph Lister... 1895. Before antiseptics there was no sanitation, especially in medicine.

DONNIE:
That's easy. Antiseptics.

GRETCHEN:
I should go. For physics. Monnitoff says I have to write an essay on the greatest invention ever to benefit mankind.

DONNIE:
What makes you think I'm not?

GRETCHEN:
Donnie Darko is a cool name. Sounds like a superhero.

DONNIE:
I'm sorry. I was in jail once.  I accidentally burned down this house. It was abandoned. I got held back in school again. Can't drive until I'm eighteen.  I think when I grow up I want to be a painter. Or maybe a writer or maybe both. Then I'll write a book and draw the illustrations like a comic book. You know, change things.

GRETCHEN:
He fled. They still can't find him.  My mom and I had to change our names and stuff. I thought Gretchen sounded kind of cool.

DONNIE:
Wow. Did he go to jail?

GRETCHEN:
He stabbed my mom four times in the chest.

DONNIE:
Oh, I... have those too.  What kind of problems does your dad have?

GRETCHEN:
Yeah. My parents got divorced. My mom has a restraining order against my stepdad.  He has... emotional problems.

DONNIE:
So... you just moved here?

GRETCHEN:
Fuck them.

DONNIE:
I'm not. But you should check your backpack 'cause those guys like to steal shit.

GRETCHEN:
Don't look so freaked.

DONNIE:
Sure.

GRETCHEN:
Wanna walk me home?

DONNIE:
School's cancelled.

GRETCHEN:
Hey...

DONNIE:
Hey...

MS. FARMER:
If you don't complete the assignment, you'll get a zero for the day.

DONNIE:
People aren't that simple.

DONNIE:
Well, yeah... OK, but you're not listening to me. There are other things that need to be taken into account here. Like the whole spectrum of human emotion. You're just lumping everything into these two categories... and, like, denying everything else.

MS. FARMER:
Fear and love are the deepest of human emotions.

DONNIE:
Well, life isn't that simple. So what if Ling Ling kept the cash and returned the wallet? That has nothing to do with either fear or love.

MS. FARMER:
The Lifeline is divided that way.

DONNIE:
I just don't get this. Everything can't be lumped into two categories. That's too simple.

MS. FARMER:
Just place an X in the appropriate place on the Lifeline.

DONNIE:
I'm sorry, Ms. Farmer, I just don't get this.

ROSE:
It feels wonderful.

DONNIE:
How does it feel to have a wacko for a son?

ROSE:
If I'm lucky.  So... I won't be back until the first. Your dad will be back on Sunday, so I've put Elizabeth in charge until then. She has the car... so she can drive you to your therapy tomorrow.

DONNIE:
Do you get to meet Ed?

ROSE:
I have to take the girls to Los Angeles tomorrow.

DONNIE:
Fine. You know, Dr. Thurman isn't so bad a lady. I can tell her anything.

ROSE:
He can't, Samantha. He's been suspended from afterschool activities. Donnie... are you still with us?  How was your therapy session tonight?

ROSE:
That is a terrible nickname.

DONNIE:
Grandma Death.

DONNIE:
Then why don't you start taking the goddamn pills?

ROSE:
You know... it would be nice to look at you some time... and see my son. I don't recognise this person today.

DONNIE:
I stopped rolling houses in the sixth grade, Mom.  Get out of my room.

ROSE:
I wish I knew where you went at night.  Did you toilet paper the Johnson's house?

ROSE:
We will not have this kind of language at the dinner table.

DONNIE:
Oh, please tell me, Elizabeth, how exactly does one suck a fuck?

ROSE:
When did you stop taking your medication?

DONNIE:
You're such a fuckass.

ROSE:
No, a year of partying is enough. She'll be going to Harvard this fall.

DONNIE:
Will you still be working at Yarn Barn? 'Cause that's a great place to raise children.

EDDIE:
I know I'm not the best... communicator.  But whatever happens in your life... whatever obstacles you come up against... you just say... and do whatever is in your heart. You be honest... and tell the truth... even if they look at you funny... and they will. They'll tell you that you're wrong. They'll call you a fool.  But what you've got to understand, son, is that almost all of those people are full of bullshit... and they're scared of people like you. Because you're smarter than all of them.

DONNIE:
I know, Dad.

EDDIE:
You're my only son...

DONNIE:
A lot of people. Teachers. Younger kids. It's like they're afraid of me for some reason.  But that's OK... because I know I deserve it.

EDDIE:
Who's been giving you weird looks?

DONNIE:
I guess she just lost faith in the world.

EDDIE:
You're right. Roberta Sparrow was famous for her gem collections. Kids used to try and steal stuff from her all the time. Over the years... as she got older, she became more and more of a recluse... now she just likes to stay up there all by herself.

DONNIE:
You know, Roberta Sparrow. We almost hit her with the car the other day.

EDDIE:
Grandma Death.

DONNIE:
Grandma Death.

EDDIE:
Oh, shit!

EDDIE:
You tell Dr. Thurman whatever you want.

DONNIE:
So we're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows?

EDDIE:
No... apparently they can't tell us what happened yet. Something about a matching serial number that got burned.  But I had to sign a form saying I wouldn't talk to anyone about it.

DONNIE:
Where it came from?

EDDIE:
Know what?

DONNIE:
Do they know yet?

EDDIE:
Good Lord.  So the construction guys say it'll take about a week to fix the roof. Damn airline better not fuck us on the shingle match.

DONNIE:
It was great. We had peanutbutter sandwiches and apples and honey at snacktime. And then during showand tell, my stuffed walrus was a big hit.

EDDIE:
So how was school today?

MS. POMEROY:
Then go find her, Donnie. Don't let her get away.  She was right about the rabbits. Go.

DONNIE:
I think I already have.  But now she won't even talk to me.

MS. POMEROY:
So... will Donnie find his Cellar Door?

MS. POMEROY:
Sometimes it's the only thing that keeps us going.

DONNIE:
Cellar door.

MS. POMEROY:
A famous linguist once said... that of all the phrases in the English language, of all the endless combinations of words in all of history... that Cellar Door is the most beautiful.

DONNIE:
What's Cellar Door?

MS. POMEROY:
Tell them that everything is going to be just fine.  It is up to the children to save themselves these days. Because the parents... they don't have a clue.

DONNIE:
What do I tell the rest of the class when they ask about you?

MS. POMEROY:
Thank you, Donnie. And you're a good student. Lazy... but a good student. Unlike most of the others, you question Mom and Dad's rules.

DONNIE:
That's bullshit. You're a good teacher.

MS. POMEROY:
I don't know. That's a good question... but suffice to say that I am no longer your English teacher. They fired me.

DONNIE:
Where are you going?

MS. POMEROY:
Donnie... it's Friday. Shouldn't you be off with your friends, scaring old people?

DONNIE:
Ms. Pomeroy... what's going on?

DONNIE:
Of course. A rabbit is not like us. It has no history books... it has no knowledge of sorrow or regret. I like bunnies and all. They're cute... and they're horny. And if you're cute and horny... then you're probably happy that you don't know who you are... or why you're even alive. But the only thing I've known rabbits to do is have sex as many times as possible before they die.

MS. POMEROY:
Is the death of one species less tragic than another?

DONNIE:
Why should I mourn for a rabbit like it was a human?

MS. POMEROY:
Because the rabbits are us, Donnie.

DONNIE:
Why should we care?

MS. POMEROY:
And when the other rabbits hear of Fiver's vision, do they believe him?  It could be the death of an entire way of life, the end of an era.

DONNIE:
A sixfoottall bunny rabbit.

MS. POMEROY:
Who is Frank?

DONNIE:
Well... they say it right when they are ripping the place to shreds. When they flood the house. That like... destruction is a form of creation. So the fact that they burn the money is... ironic. They just want to see what happens when they tear the world apart.  They want to change things.

MS. POMEROY:
Donnie Darko, perhaps, given your recent brush with mass destruction, you can give us your opinion?

DR. THURMAN:
Goodbye, Donald.

DONNIE:
Goodbye, Dr. Thurman.

DR. THURMAN:
Donald, an atheist is someone who denies altogether the existence of a God. You are an agnostic. An agnostic is someone who believes that there can be no proof of the existence of God... but does not deny the possibility that God exists.

DONNIE:
Thank you.

DR. THURMAN:
Your medication. They're placebos. Just pills made out of water.

DR. THURMAN:
You will survive this... Donald. I promise you that you will survive. You must let me help you.  And when I clap my hands together, you will wake up.

DONNIE:
It's too late. I've already ruined my life.

DR. THURMAN:
If the sky were to suddenly open up... there would be no law... there would be no rule. There would only be you and your memories... the choices you've made and the people you've touched. The life that has been carved out from your subconscious is the only evidence by which you will be judged... by which you must judge yourself. Because when this world ends, there will only be you and him... and no one else.

DONNIE:
He's right there... He can read my mind and he'll show me the way out of this. The sky is going to open up... and then He will reveal himself to me.

DR. THURMAN:
Where is he, Donald?

DONNIE:
I can see him right now!

DR. THURMAN:
Who is he going to kill?

DONNIE:
Frank is going to kill.

DR. THURMAN:
What is going to happen?

DONNIE:
Soon. Time is almost up.

DR. THURMAN:
When will this happen?

DONNIE:
It would have to be God's portal. They will lead me to it. Then I will go back in time... and I won't feel regret anymore.

DR. THURMAN:
Then how is time travel possible?

DONNIE:
Grandma Death will teach me how. Soon.

DR. THURMAN:
How is that possible?

DONNIE:
I have the power to build a time machine.

DR. THURMAN:
Where are we going, Donald?

DR. THURMAN:
Where are we going?

DONNIE:
I think so. I think that's one of the clues. It's a clue that tells us... to keep going.

DR. THURMAN:
God exists because you're horny.

DONNIE:
Because I'm so horny.

DR. THURMAN:
Why?

DONNIE:
I think now that he might...

DR. THURMAN:
If God exists?

DONNIE:
I have to obey him... because he saved my life. He controls me and I have to obey him or I'll be left all alone... and I'll never figure out what all of this means...

DR. THURMAN:
Why did you do these things, Donnie? Did Frank tell you to commit these crimes?

DONNIE:
Yes. I flooded my school... and I burned down that pervert's house. I think I only have a few days left... before they catch me.

DR. THURMAN:
You've done it again?

DONNIE:
That I did it again.

DR. THURMAN:
What else makes you feel regret?

DONNIE:
Regret.

DR. THURMAN:
How did you feel... being denied those Hungry Hungry Hippos?

DONNIE:
Hungry Hungry Hippos.

DR. THURMAN:
What did you want for Christmas that year?

DONNIE:
They... didn't buy me what I wanted for Christmas that year.

DR. THURMAN:
Do you wish that you were punished by your parents instead?

DONNIE:
Yes. I went to jail.

DR. THURMAN:
But you were punished.

DONNIE:
People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone.

DR. THURMAN:
But it was an accident. The house was under construction.

DONNIE:
People get hurt.

DR. THURMAN:
Is it Frank who wants you to destroy the world, to set the world on fire?

DONNIE:
I... I was playing with fire.

DR. THURMAN:
So, your parents... why did you disappoint them?

DONNIE:
Yes.

DR. THURMAN:
And when I clap my hands together twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?

DR. THURMAN:
Have you ever made love, Donald?

DONNIE:
Yeah... you know...  Fucking.

DR. THURMAN:
The good stuff.

DONNIE:
I mean... Gretchen... She won't even let me kiss her. She says because it's our first kiss... she's, like, waiting for this big... moment or something. I just don't get it. I just want to get it over with so we can move on to the good stuff.

DR. THURMAN:
I know.

DONNIE:
Whoa.  That's OK, Dr. Thurman, it's nothing to be embarrassed about. I have sexual fantasies all the time too.

DONNIE:
You know... every week I come in here and I tell you stuff... and it's all embarrassing. I tell you stuff that I don't tell anyone else... and you know what? It's your turn, Dr. Thurman. I'm not saying anything else until you tell me something embarrassing about yourself.

DR. THURMAN:
Are you embarrassed by these things that you see?

DONNIE:
Yeah, but if I told her about the other stuff about Frank...

DR. THURMAN:
Have you told Gretchen about the spears?

DONNIE:
Nothing.

DR. THURMAN:
What did you find?

DONNIE:
It was just like she described them in her book. Like they were alive. The way that they looked... moved... smelled. They were like workers... assigned to each one of us.  I followed my spear... and I found something...

DR. THURMAN:
And they grow out of our stomachs?

DR. THURMAN:
No. That makes you keep searching.

DONNIE:
I'd like to believe that I'm not... but I've just never seen any proof. So I just choose not to bother with it. It's, like, I could spend my whole life thinking about it... debating it in my head. Weighing the pros and cons. And in the end, I still wouldn't have any proof. So... I don't even debate it any more. Because it's absurd.  I don't want to be alone.  So, does that make me, like, an atheist?

DR. THURMAN:
Do you feel alone right now?

DONNIE:
No. She died when I was eight. We couldn't find her for days. She went and crawled underneath our back porch...

DR. THURMAN:
Is Callie still around?

DONNIE:
It reminded me of my dog Callie.

DR. THURMAN:
How does that make you feel?

DONNIE:
I think that Frank wants me to go to this woman.  She wrote a book about time travel. Frank asked me if I believed in time travel. That can't just be a random coincidence.  My dad almost hit her with the car the other day, and she said the creepiest thing. She said that every living creature on this earth dies alone.

DR. THURMAN:
A sign from whom?

DONNIE:
I don't know. Gretchen has a theory. That Frank is a sign. I told her I thought it was ridiculous.

DR. THURMAN:
Who is they? Is Frank part of some larger group?

DONNIE:
I don't think so. It's like a TV station. And they're tuned into mine and no one else's.

DR. THURMAN:
Can anyone else see him?

DONNIE:
Four times... so far.

DR. THURMAN:
How many times have you seen Frank?

DR. THURMAN:
Donnie... I want to hear about your friend Frank.

DONNIE:
No, I don't think about fucking my family. That's sick!

DR. THURMAN:
What about your family, Donnie?

DONNIE:
I just turn the volume down and think about fucking Alyssa Milano.

DR. THURMAN:
Who is the boss?

DONNIE:
I think... about... Who's the Boss?

DR. THURMAN:
What else do you think about during school?

DONNIE:
I think about... fucking a lot during school.

DR. THURMAN:
I asked you about school.

DONNIE:
I think about girls a lot.

DR. THURMAN:
How are things going at school?

DONNIE:
Yes.

DR. THURMAN:
Do you think a lot about girls?

DONNIE:
Gretchen. We're going together now.

DR. THURMAN:
What is her name?

DONNIE:
I met a girl.

DR. THURMAN:
So, tell me about your day, Donald.

DONNIE:
Yes.

DR. THURMAN:
And when I clap my hands twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?

DONNIE:
No.  That's stupid.

DR. THURMAN:
Do you believe that the world is coming to an end?

DONNIE:
Into the future.  Then he said that the world was coming to an end.

DR. THURMAN:
Follow him where?

DONNIE:
He said to follow him.

DR. THURMAN:
Frank... instructed you... to get out of bed... just before this happened.

DONNIE:
A jet engine fell on my house... landed on my bed. While I was talking to Frank on the golf course.

DR. THURMAN:
I don't own a television.

DONNIE:
Don't you watch the news?

DR. THURMAN:
How so?

DONNIE:
I think he saved my life.

DR. THURMAN:
Frank.

DONNIE:
His name is Frank.

DR. THURMAN:
Would you like to talk about this friend?

DONNIE:
So, I met a new friend.

DR. THURMAN:
All of this... certainly isn't your mother's fault, Donald.

DONNIE:
I've been taking it. I just like to make her feel guilty for all of this. You know, abuse her. Psychologically.

DR. THURMAN:
Your mother said that you've been skipping cycles of your medication.

DONNIE:
Everything is going to be just fine.

ELIZABETH:
Okay, but it has to be a small one.

DONNIE:
Mom and Dad won't be back until Sunday night. It's Halloween Carnival. We should throw a party. We could totally get away with it.

DONNIE:
Congratulations.

ELIZABETH:
I got in. I'm going to Harvard.

ELIZABETH:
That's a nice name.  OK, let me see it.

DONNIE:
Her name is Gretchen.

ELIZABETH:
Yeah... well, that's not the way the world works. If you keep being too honest, the world will eventually find a way to destroy you.

DONNIE:
I was just being honest.

ELIZABETH:
It's not that. I mean mouthing off to your teachers. I'll admit... when Dad told me what you said to Ms. Farmer, I laughed my ass off.

DONNIE:
Well, don't worry... I'm taking my medication.

ELIZABETH:
No I don't.  She worries about you.

DONNIE:
Because you tell Mom everything.

ELIZABETH:
Why would I tell Mom?

DONNIE:
You're not gonna tell Mom, are you?

ELIZABETH:
What's her name?

DONNIE:
Yeah.

ELIZABETH:
So I hear you have a girlfriend.

DONNIE:
Guess who wrote it?

ELIZABETH:
What does time travel have to do with philosophy?

DONNIE:
It's called The Philosophy of Time Travel.

ELIZABETH:
Maybe you'd like to tell Mom and Dad why you stopped taking your medication.

DONNIE:
Whoa, Elizabeth. A little hostile, there. Maybe you should be the one in therapy. Then Mom and Dad can pay someone two hundred dollars an hour to listen to all of your thoughts... so we won't have to.

DONNIE:
Well, I think you're the fucking AntiChrist.

JIM CUNNINGHAM:
I think you are afraid to ask me for advice. I think that you are a very troubled... confused young man. I think you're searching for answers in all the wrong places.

DONNIE:
Well, Jim, I think you're full of shit!

JIM CUNNINGHAM:
Well, Gerald, I think you're afraid.

DONNIE:
Gerald.

JIM CUNNINGHAM:
Excuse me? What's your name, son?

DONNIE:
How much are they paying you to be here?

DR. THURMAN:
But let me remind you that this treatment is... experimental.

ROSE:
If that's what you think is necessary.

DR. THURMAN:
I would like to put him through more hypnotherapy... and increase his medication.

ROSE:
I... What can we do?

DR. THURMAN:
He has described lengthy conversations... physical encounters with what I believe to be a manifestation of his subconscious mind.

ROSE:
You're telling me my son has an imaginary friend?

DR. THURMAN:
Donnie is experiencing what is commonly called a daylight hallucination.

ROSE:
Frank?

DR. THURMAN:
Frank... the giant bunny rabbit?

ROSE:
Come again?

DR. THURMAN:
Has your son ever told you about Frank?

ROSE:
Well, you know about his past. And when you said to look for signs of aggression... He was recently suspended from school for insulting his gym teacher.

DR. THURMAN:
What I think is going on with your son.

ROSE:
Thank you for seeing us... We... just felt that it was time to discuss...

EDDIE:
He died, remember? On the way to the prom.  He was doomed.

ROSE:
He was a year ahead of us?

EDDIE:
Frankie Feedler. You remember him from high school?

ROSE:
What?

EDDIE:
You are entering a new dimension of sight and sound...

ROSE:
So let me get this straight. No airline will claim ownership of the engine. So we have to wait for the FAA to decide who fixes my roof.  Fuck that. We're taking the money out of savings.

EDDIE:
You're not a bitch.

ROSE:
Our son just called me a bitch.

ELIZABETH:
Don't worry, Mom. Just go, you'll miss your flight.

ROSE:
Here are the keys to the Taurus. There's plenty of groceries in the fridge. And I left money on the kitchen table. And don't forget...

ELIZABETH:
I caught him flushing pills down the toilet. He knows you check the container.

ROSE:
It is a big deal.

ELIZABETH:
I didn't realise it was such a big deal.

ROSE:
How did you know 

ELIZABETH:
No. I took a year off to be with you.  Of course I care. Don't get angry.  What?

ELIZABETH:
You can suck a fuck.

ROSE:
That's enough.

ELIZABETH:
Did you just call me a fuckass?

ELIZABETH:
Donnie? You're a dick.

ROSE:
Excuse me?

ROSE:
If you think Michael Dukakis will provide for this country prior to the point when you decide to squeeze one out, then I think you're misinformed.

ELIZABETH:
I haven't been accepted yet, mother.

LEROY:
I guess they made him do it.

PRINCIPAL COLE:
How did this happen?

LEROY:
Yep.

PRINCIPAL COLE:
Christ. Is that an axe?

LEROY:
What else? Shit, Principal Cole, you ain't gonna believe what else.

PRINCIPAL COLE:
What else?

LEROY:
I got twelve classrooms full of water. All coming from a busted water main.

MS. FARMER:
Rose... I don't know if you realise how great an opportunity this is for our daughters. This has been a dream of ours for a long time.  Sometimes I doubt your commitment to Sparkle Motion.

ROSE:
Oh, Kitty, I don't know. This is so lastminute... Eddie is in New York...

MS. FARMER:
Yes. And believe me, of all the other mothers I would never dream of asking you, given the predicament with your son. But none of the other mothers are able to go.

ROSE:
But now you can't go.

MS. FARMER:
Rose... I have to appear at his arraignment tomorrow morning. And as you know, the girls also leave for Los Angeles tomorrow morning. Now, as their coach... I was the obvious choice to chaperone them on the trip.

ROSE:
Beg pardon?

MS. FARMER:
Please! Don't say those words.  Well... as you can see... many of us are devastated by this news. This is obviously some kind of conspiracy meant to destroy an innocent man. And I have taken it upon myself to spearhead the Jim Cunningham defence campaign. But unfortunately my civic duties have created a conflict of interest... which involves you.

ROSE:
Yes, I saw the news. Something about a kiddieporn dungeon.

MS. FARMER:
Rose, we have a crisis.  I am sure that you are aware of the horrible allegations against Jim Cunningham.

ROSE:
Kitty...

MS. FARMER:
Rose.

MS. FARMER:
Rose, I'll tell you this because our daughters have been on dance team together for two years and I respect you as a WOMAN. But after witnessing your son's behaviour today, I have... significant doubts...  Our paths through life must be righteous. I urge you to go home and look in the mirror and pray that your son does not succumb to the path of fear.

ROSE:
Kitty, I don't know what to say. They've suspended him for two days.  Ever since this jet fiasco, I honestly don't know what has gotten into him.

MS. FARMER:
I think we've all seen Bonanza.

ROSE:
Do you even know who Graham Greene is?

MS. FARMER:
The PTA is here to acknowledge that there is pornography in our school's curriculum.

ROSE:
Excuse me... but what is the real issue here? The PTA doesn't ban books from school.

MS. FARMER:
I AM THE PTA! And I say that this FILTH is directly related to this vandalism.

PRINCIPAL COLE:
This meeting of the PTA was called to inform the parents of our ongoing investigation...

MS. FARMER:
And how do they do this? They FLOOD the house... by breaking through the water main!

MS. FARMER:
The bottom line... Mr. Cole... is that there is material being taught to our children that is cause for this destructive behaviour.

PRINCIPAL COLE:
Kitty...

MS. FARMER:
Mr. Cole... not only am I a TEACHER... but I am also a PARENT of a Middlesex child. Therefore, I am the ONLY person here who transcends the parentteacher bridge.

PRINCIPAL COLE:
Kitty, I would appreciate... if you could wait...

RONALD:
I stole four beers from my dad.

SEAN:
We got eggs, water balloons, and a dozen rolls of toilet paper.

RONALD:
Not Vanity. He's a homo.

SEAN:
Bullshit. Smurfette fucks all the other smurfs. That's why Papa Smurf made her, 'cause the other smurfs were getting too horny.

RONALD:
Smurfette doesn't fuck.

SEAN:
No more fuckin' for her.

RONALD:
Wicked.

SEAN:
Raspberry.

RONALD:
What is this shit?

RONALD:
Let's go to Donnie's house. His parents are both at work.

SEAN:
All right! 755. Everybody goes home.

SEAN:
Fuck yeah there is! If the bus doesn't show up in thirty minutes, you're supposed to go straight home.

RONALD:
There's no rule!

SEAN:
You know, there's, like, this rule. We get to go home at 755.

RONALD:
Maybe Martha Moo finally went nuts and hijacked the bus.

SEAN:
Go back to China, bitch!

RONALD:
Chut up!

JEFFREY:
Aunt Barbara. I love you, but you're not gonna get it.

AUNT BARBARA:
Sometimes it helps to talk things over. For instance, many marriages are saved by.

JEFFREY:
I don't want to talk about it. Everything's okay now. I don't want to talk about it.

AUNT BARBARA:
Okay honey.

JEFFREY:
Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look, I better go.

AUNT BARBARA:
I've seen a few.

JEFFREY:
Oh yeah? Have you seen any?

AUNT BARBARA:
Okay honey. That sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.

JEFFREY:
Will you tell Mom when she gets home from the hospital that I've gone to dinner at Sandy Williams' house?

AUNT BARBARA:
I'm not sick.

JEFFREY:
Doctor Gynde, my whole family's sick. What's going on?

JEFFREY:
No, I'm just going to walk around the neighborhood. Don't worry.

AUNT BARBARA:
Jeffrey, you're not going down by Lincoln, are you?

JEFFREY:
Aunt Barbara. I'll try not to get depressed.

AUNT BARBARA:
I think it's important not to get depressed. Depression is a terrible thing. They say it can bring on illness.

JEFFREY:
Yeah. How's Dad?

AUNT BARBARA:
You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?

JEFFREY:
I sent a trunk home yesterday. This is all I have.

FRANK:
Right Ben. LET'S GO FUCK. I'll fuck anything that moves.

BEN:

FRANK:

BEN:

BEN:

FRANK:
Shit. Let's drink to something else. Let's drink to fuckin'. Say here's to your fuck Frank.

BEN:
To your health, Frank.

BEN:
Darling, where are the glasses? Oh, here they are.

FRANK:
Fuckin' good, real fuckin' good. You know this little tid bit, Dorothy, and this thing, here,  is a neighbor. What the shit we're doin' with a neighbor, I don't know. Goddam!!!  This is the suavest guy I know. Look at you. You're one beautiful fucker, Ben. I love this jacket and that cigarette holder of yours. Shit, that is too fuckin' much. Where's those glasses. This beer's gonna get too warm. I can't stand fuckin' warm beer. It makes me puke.

BEN:
Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?

FRANK:

BEN:
Certainly Frank.  Darling, get some glasses. We'll have some beer with Frank. Won't you sit down?

FRANK:
Suave. Goddam are you suave, you fucker. You want some beer?

BEN:
Fine. Welcome. Come sit down.

FRANK:
Hey, I brought some friends. And some beer.

BEN:
Frank. Come in.

JEFFREY:
Oh my God. Is her son OK?

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS:
Not yet.

JEFFREY:
Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS:
Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon. I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different. He slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid Frank's place.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS:
We're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can.

JEFFREY:
Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. Hurry. I'm in the apartment. Hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS:
Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?

JEFFREY:
Detective Williams!! Detective Williams!!

JEFFREY:
Yes sir.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS:
For now. Alright, you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you. Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later.

JEFFREY:
Yes sir. I sure am.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS:
You're all through with this now?

JEFFREY:
Only you and the photo lab.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS:
Who knows you have these?

JEFFREY:
No, not at all.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS:
Is Sandy part of this?

JEFFREY:
I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS:
Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?

JEFFREY:
I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs, and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and...  ...and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.

JEFFREY:
And that man came out with a third man  this welldressed guy. Here's the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son.

JEFFREY:
Okay, I gotta tell you. I've discovered some things. Anyway I have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. The first picture is this.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS:
Okay?

JEFFREY:
Yeah.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS:
Okay, come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.

JEFFREY:
Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS:
Jeffrey! Come on in.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS:
It's blue. Blue velvet.

JEFFREY:
What color is it?

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS:
Blue. It's Blue Velvet.

JEFFREY:
What is this? What color is it?

JEFFREY:
Yeah. I get it.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS:
I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.

JEFFREY:
Why do you do it?

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS:
Yes I have  so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.

JEFFREY:
I guess you've seen some bad things.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS:
Yes.

JEFFREY:
Is that why you say it's horrible?

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS:
The criminals are winning.

JEFFREY:
Anything you can tell me?

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS:
Okay.

JEFFREY:
These are beautiful. How's the case coming?

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS:
If you want to come up a minute, I'll show you some pictures.

JEFFREY:
Yes?

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS:
Jeffrey?

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS:
And it's horrible too.  I'm sorry Jeffrey. That's the way it has to be. Anyway. I'm sure you do understand.

JEFFREY:
It must be great.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS:
I was the same way when I was your age. I guess that's what got me into this business.

JEFFREY:
I understand. I'm just real curious like you said.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS:
Detective Williams here. Yeah. Tell him to go to Sergeant Milton. Yeah, copy.  Well, Jeffrey, you found something which is very interesting to us. Very interesting. I know you must be curious to know more.  But. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find, but also not to ask more about the case. One day, when it's all sewed up, I'll let you know all the details. Right now, though, I can't.

JEFFREY:
Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS:
Come into the study a minute.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS:
Come on. I'll drive you home. It's on my way.

JEFFREY:
Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS:
By the way, Jeffrey, this story isn't going to the press and I'm going to ask you to consider all you've heard strictly confidential. Do not discuss this business with anyone, but me, or other police personnel. Got it?

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS:
Yep, that's right. Let's take a look at it.

JEFFREY:
Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS:
You did? A human ear?

JEFFREY:
He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. There behind Vista, I found an ear.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS:
Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?

JEFFREY:
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont  I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont  Beaumont's Hardware Store?

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS:
Yes.

JEFFREY:
Are you Detective Williams?

DOROTHY:
Hold me. I'M FALLING!

JEFFREY:
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.

DOROTHY:
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!

JEFFREY:
Don? Where is he?

DOROTHY:
Hold me, Don.

DOROTHY:
Don. Help him. HELP HIM!! DONNY!!!!

JEFFREY:
Who, Dorothy?

DOROTHY:
They hurt his head.

DOROTHY:
My secret lover.

JEFFREY:
It's okay. It's okay.

DOROTHY:
Where have you been?  Oh God, they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God.

DOROTHY:
Oh God, Jeffrey, is that you? Oh God.

JEFFREY:
Yeah, it's me.

DOROTHY:
No.  Hi baby.

JEFFREY:
Oh no.

JEFFREY:
You look beautiful to me.

DOROTHY:
I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.

JEFFREY:
What?

DOROTHY:
Okay. Soon? Do you think I'm too fat?

JEFFREY:
I'll call you.

JEFFREY:
I think I better go.

DOROTHY:
I want you to stay with me.

JEFFREY:
I guess I should go.

JEFFREY:
No. Not really.  But also because I really want you to be alright.

DOROTHY:
Why are you here?  HMMMMMMMM!!!! OK.

JEFFREY:
Yes.

DOROTHY:
I did. Are you?

JEFFREY:
You called me Jeffrey.

DOROTHY:
If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell, it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.

JEFFREY:
Dorothy. No!

DOROTHY:
There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in so much darkness though with things moving. There is darkness sucking me. It's kissing me and darkness is entering me. In every hole. It's opening me to a death.

JEFFREY:
I'm glad you do.

DOROTHY:
Men are crazy. Then they put their craziness into me. Then it makes me crazy. Then they aren't so crazy for awhile. Then they put their craziness in me again.  It's burning me, but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?

JEFFREY:
There's no disease, I can tell you.

DOROTHY:
You put your disease in me. Your semen. It's hot and full of disease.

JEFFREY:
You what?

DOROTHY:
Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.

JEFFREY:
I didn't mean to hurt you.

JEFFREY:
No, it's not Don.

DOROTHY:
I love you Don with all my heart.

DOROTHY:
Just get outta my bed.

JEFFREY:
Wait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For cryin' out loud!

DOROTHY:
And sometimes you think you don't?! Well, get away then!

JEFFREY:
Sometimes I think I do.

DOROTHY:
I asked first.

JEFFREY:
Do you love me?

DOROTHY:
Do you love me?

DOROTHY:
Kiss me.

JEFFREY:
Look, snap out of it, will ya?

DOROTHY:
What if Frank came over here and found us?

JEFFREY:
Come on Dorothy.

DOROTHY:
Beeeee careful.

JEFFREY:
Shut up.

DOROTHY:
Does that scare you?

JEFFREY:
Okay. I know you've been scared. Now you want to scare someone.

DOROTHY:
Frank would open you.

JEFFREY:
That wouldn't be too good, would it?

DOROTHY:
What if I told Frank that you opened me?

JEFFREY:
Yes.

DOROTHY:
You like to open me, don't you?

DOROTHY:
No police!!!  No police!!

JEFFREY:
No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. Go to the police.

DOROTHY:
I want you to hurt me.

JEFFREY:
What do you want?

DOROTHY:
Do you want to do bad things?  Anything, anything.

JEFFREY:
Whatiya mean?

DOROTHY:
Are you a bad boy?

JEFFREY:
I'm doing it.

DOROTHY:
What do you want to do?

JEFFREY:
Sure I do.

DOROTHY:
Do you like my body?

JEFFREY:
That's good.

DOROTHY:
I'm not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong.

JEFFREY:
I sure don't hate you.

DOROTHY:
No. How could he? Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  Don't hate me.

JEFFREY:
Frank is coming?

DOROTHY:
Yes. Frank

JEFFREY:
I'm sorry, maybe I better go Dorothy.

DOROTHY:
It used to make me laugh, but.

JEFFREY:
Hello.

DOROTHY:
Come in.

DOROTHY:
Please, please stay.

JEFFREY:
No. I should go.

DOROTHY:
Or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.

JEFFREY:
Yes.

DOROTHY:
Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. You like me, huh?

JEFFREY:
I came back to help you. You said do I let girls sneak into my house. You know where I live. If you need to, come to where I live, OK?

DOROTHY:
Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me?

JEFFREY:
No. But you're in very big trouble.

DOROTHY:
Don? Are you in with them?

JEFFREY:
Who is Don?

JEFFREY:
No. Please, Dorothy. Why are you in so much trouble?

DOROTHY:
Falling.

JEFFREY:
No.

DOROTHY:
Look.

JEFFREY:
Take it easy. What's goin' on anyway? Why are you in so much trouble?

DOROTHY:
I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.

JEFFREY:
There you go again. Stop saying that. You can make it.

DOROTHY:
Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.

DOROTHY:
Who's it, you mean.

JEFFREY:
Nice guy. Who's he?

DOROTHY:
I'm alright. Go hide. This won't take long. Be quiet.

JEFFREY:
Frank? Can you stand up?

DOROTHY:
Oh shit.

JEFFREY:
Same here.

DOROTHY:
I liked being with you last night.

JEFFREY:
That's not crazy. I like you too.

DOROTHY:
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from, but I like you.

JEFFREY:
I, uh.

DOROTHY:
Why are you here. Whatiya want?

DOROTHY:
Yeah, hurry up though.

JEFFREY:
Hi, can I come in?

JEFFREY:
OK.

DOROTHY:
It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now.

JEFFREY:
Don't say that.

DOROTHY:
Did I say that? I didn't mean it, or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die.

JEFFREY:
Then don't talk about killing.

DOROTHY:
Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.

JEFFREY:
Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go.

DOROTHY:
Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you.

JEFFREY:
No. What is happening?

DOROTHY:
You don't?

JEFFREY:
No.

DOROTHY:
Do you know?

JEFFREY:
Next Christmas. Is he Santa Claus who has left a present for Dorothy? What was it? An ear? Another ear?!!  What was it?

JEFFREY:
What?

DOROTHY:
I made it go down the toilet.

DOROTHY:
You can be my special friend and come and put that in me.

JEFFREY:
Yes, I like you.

DOROTHY:
Do you like me?

JEFFREY:
No, please. I won't.

DOROTHY:
You can hit me, if you want to.

DOROTHY:
You can kiss them if you want. Feel them. They're getting hard.

JEFFREY:
Yes.

DOROTHY:
See my nipples?

JEFFREY:
Yes.

DOROTHY:

JEFFREY:

JEFFREY:
Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.

DOROTHY:
NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.

JEFFREY:
No. Come on.

DOROTHY:
How'd you like it if someone sneaked into your house and watched you.  Get undressed. I want to see you.

JEFFREY:
Never before this.

DOROTHY:
How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress?

JEFFREY:
Then you got undressed.

DOROTHY:
THEN WHAT?

JEFFREY:
Well.

DOROTHY:
That's right. That's what I said. You have a good memory. Then what?

JEFFREY:
You said hello, to Frank. You wanted to talk to someone? Don? And little Donny. You said something about Momma loves you. And something about a Meadow Lane. Something in an hour. I don't remember any more.

DOROTHY:
The phone. What did you hear on the phone. Tell me. Word for word.

JEFFREY:
I saw you come in, talk on the phone. Get undressed.

DOROTHY:
Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.

JEFFREY:
I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything but see you.

DOROTHY:
An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before.

JEFFREY:
I was an experiment. Just to see if I could do it.

DOROTHY:
Shit. You better tell me something.

JEFFREY:
Nobody.

DOROTHY:
What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?

JEFFREY:
I wanted to see you.

DOROTHY:

DOROTHY:

JEFFREY:

DOROTHY:
Oh yeah, that's good.

JEFFREY:
Nope, it's new stuff. No smell.

DOROTHY:
Oh God, that stuff stinks.

JEFFREY:
Pest control, gotta do your apartment.

DOROTHY:
Yes? What is it?

YELLOW MAN:
Okay, I'm goin'. You'll see, I'll get you.

DOROTHY:
No way, get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.

YELLOW MAN:
He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. He's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin  let me give you the real thing. Let me wet my whistle, baby.

DOROTHY:
Oh he forced you, huh?

YELLOW MAN:
Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me, and you and really it's all thanks to Don, isn't it. Remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.

DOROTHY:
'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.

YELLOW MAN:
He's comin' back? What for?

DOROTHY:
Alright, suit yourself.

YELLOW MAN:
Bull.

DOROTHY:
Yeah, but get outta here. He's comin' back.

YELLOW MAN:

FRANK:

DOROTHY:
Frank, he didn't mean it. Leave him alone. Come on. He didn't mean it.

DOROTHY:
If you want to.

FRANK:

DOROTHY:
Those are my breasts.

FRANK:
Don't say PLEASE, Fuckhead. WHAT ARE THESE?

DOROTHY:
Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.

FRANK:
Look at these. What are these?

FRANK:
Then, shut up!

DOROTHY:
Yes, but.

FRANK:
You want to see him too, right?

DOROTHY:
Frank?

FRANK:
Hey Tits, I'm taking your neighbor to the country. Maybe something for you too.

DOROTHY:
Where are we going, Frank?

FRANK:
From the neighborhood?  Shut the fuck up.  You like telephones? Huh? You wanta go for a ride?

DOROTHY:
He's a friend. From the neighborhood. We were just talking.

FRANK:
Who's this fuck?

FRANK:
Baby wants to fuck.

DOROTHY:
Mommy's here.

FRANK:
MOMMY!

FRANK:
My bourbon.

DOROTHY:
Hello, daddy.

FRANK:
Shut up. It's daddy, shithead.

DOROTHY:
Hello, baby.

JEFFREY:
Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how many more are out there?

F.B.I. MAN:
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though, you're okay. You shot a real son of a bitch.

JEFFREY:
Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?

F.B.I. MAN:
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.

JEFFREY:
He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. To make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue, blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.

F.B.I. MAN:
We're looking for him. In your opinion, why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and husband?

FRANK:
I'll send you straight to hell, Fuck!

JEFFREY:
Yes.

FRANK:
Don't be a good neighbor to her or I'm gonna send you a love letter. Straight from my heart, fucker. You know what a love letter is? It's a bullet, straight from my gun, fucker. Once you get a love letter from me, you're fucked forever. Understand, Fuck?

FRANK:
Don't look at me, Fuck. I shoot when I see the whites of the eyes.  You like me?

JEFFREY:
Nothing.

FRANK:
What are you lookin' at?

FRANK:
Let's take our neighbor out. Let him fuckin' walk back.

JEFFREY:
What?

FRANK:
Hey? You like to walk.

FRANK:
Do you see, Ben? I can make him do anything I fuckin' please.

JEFFREY:
Here's to Ben.

FRANK:
Hey neighbor. Here's to Ben.

FRANK:

MRS. BEAUMONT:
You can't just stay out half the night and carry on, Jeffrey. There's got to be some order, Jeffrey. I thought it would have been nice to call your father when you got home but now it is much too late.

JEFFREY:
Nothing. I'm fine.

MRS. BEAUMONT:
Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?

JEFFREY:
God, you scared me.

MRS. BEAUMONT:
Of course, Jeffrey.

JEFFREY:
Can I use the car tonight?

MRS. BEAUMONT:
Alright.

JEFFREY:
No, I'm just gonna walk around.

MRS. BEAUMONT:
Do you want the car?

JEFFREY:
I'm going out for awhile.

MRS. BEAUMONT:
Jeffrey! Nobody wanted you to leave school and go to work in the store, maybe going back to school will be an option one day. I hope so.

JEFFREY:
Thanks a lot, Mom.

MRS. BEAUMONT:
It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.

JEFFREY:
What?

MRS. BEAUMONT:
He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you.

JEFFREY:
Yeah?

MRS. BEAUMONT:
Jeffrey, when you see your father.

JEFFREY:
Well. Okay.

MRS. BEAUMONT:
I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 1030. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over I need the car this morning.

JEFFREY:

JEFFREY:
Be right down.

MRS. BEAUMONT:
Jeffrey, breakfast is ready.

JEFFREY:
This is it.

MRS. BEAUMONT:
Where's all your things, Jeffrey?

JEFFREY:
Mom.

MRS. BEAUMONT:
Jeffrey, honey. Your father's condition is serious. It's going to cost so much. We just won't have the money to keep you in school. I'm telling you this now, so that you can get your things together and check out of school, honey, or whatever you have to do, it'll save you another trip back. You're going to have to work at the store.

JEFFREY:
For good? I can't Mom. Not right in the middle of the term.

MRS. BEAUMONT:
I mean, for good, Jeffrey.

MRS. WILLIAMS:
I'll get a coat for her.

JEFFREY:
Sandy?... Sandy, please.

MRS. WILLIAMS:
Nice of you to offer, Jeffrey, but certainly not. Just relax and enjoy your coffee. I'm sure Sandy will be back soon.

JEFFREY:
Sure thing, please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?

MRS. WILLIAMS:
Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.

MRS. WILLIAMS:
Anyone else? Alright Jeffrey, just a minute.

JEFFREY:
That sounds great!

MRS. WILLIAMS:
Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?

JEFFREY:
Say goodnight to Sandy.

MRS. WILLIAMS:

JEFFREY:
Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake.

JEFFREY:

MRS. WILLIAMS:
It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. Real good.

JEFFREY:
No. No thank you.

MRS. WILLIAMS:
Would you like a piece of cake?

JEFFREY:
Yeah, I know.

MRS. WILLIAMS:
I was sorry to hear about your father. I know your mother from church. It's such a shame.

JEFFREY:
Alright.

MRS. WILLIAMS:
Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?

JEFFREY:
I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.

MRS. WILLIAMS:
Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?

JEFFREY:
Hello, uh, my name is Jeffrey Beaumont. Is Detective Williams in?

JEFFREY:
Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't noticed.

MIKE:
Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE!

MIKE:
Well, most guys don't. I mean that's the point. You all mind if I take my vitamins?

JEFFREY:
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.

MIKE:
I mean, some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.

JEFFREY:
No, you're right.

MIKE:
I mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football. I mean, no offense.

JEFFREY:
Well.

MIKE:
Looks like you'd make a good runner.

JEFFREY:
No.

JEFFREY:
Good deal Dad.

MR. BEAUMONT:
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.

JEFFREY:
How ya doin' Dad?

JEFFREY:
It's good to see you, Dad.

MR. BEAUMONT:
Good to see you, son.

MR. BEAUMONT:
Uhuh.

JEFFREY:
Are you feeling okay?

MR. BEAUMONT:
Uhuh.

JEFFREY:
Looks like they've got you strapped in pretty good.

MR. BEAUMONT:
Hey Jeff.

JEFFREY:
Hi Dad.

JEFFREY:
Yeah. I just saw him outside. Maybe the robins are here.

SANDY:
Look Jeffrey.

JEFFREY:
Yes I'm going. I have to. I love you. I will, believe me.

SANDY:
No Jeffrey!!

JEFFREY:
Please get to your father and send him and the police to Dorothy's apartment right away. Be sure your father comes. Something is happening over there. They're hurting someone, the guy she loves. Tell them to hurry. I'm going over right now.

SANDY:
Go ahead!

JEFFREY:
Sandy?

SANDY:
Go ahead.

JEFFREY:
I should go with her, Sandy.

JEFFREY:
Shhh. I'll tell you.

SANDY:
Jeffrey? What's going on?

SANDY:
Right. Watch out for Mike, there.

JEFFREY:
Okay. Let's get her over to your father's.

SANDY:
Probably not. No. Why?

JEFFREY:
No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?

SANDY:
Take her to my house. My dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone. Do you have anything to put around her?

JEFFREY:
Yes.

SANDY:
Dorothy Vallens?

JEFFREY:
Dorothy!... Dorothy!

JEFFREY:
Sandy, this guy is a killer!! I promise you.

SANDY:
No.

JEFFREY:
My father has a gun at home.

JEFFREY:
Frank!!!

SANDY:
Oh my God. What's wrong?

SANDY:
Okay.

JEFFREY:
You want to dance?

SANDY:
Just a minute.

JEFFREY:
Let's wait for some slow one.

SANDY:
NO.

JEFFREY:
Really. You want to dance with someone else?

SANDY:
Really?

JEFFREY:
I can't dance fast.

SANDY:
You want to dance?

JEFFREY:
I like that idea, that's a real good idea.

SANDY:
Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?

JEFFREY:
You look beautiful.

SANDY:
It's okay.

JEFFREY:
I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.

SANDY:
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?

JEFFREY:
Where to?

SANDY:
It's good to see you.

JEFFREY:
Nothing, really! It's good to see you.

SANDY:
What was that all about?

JEFFREY:
Just some fatherly advice.

SANDY:
What is it?

JEFFREY:
Okay.

JEFFREY:
Okay. Great!

SANDY:
I should never had gotten you going on this.  Yes Jeffrey. Friday's on!

JEFFREY:
No.

SANDY:
You didn't tell him about me?

JEFFREY:
Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?

SANDY:
Everything okay?

JEFFREY:
Okay, but I promise I won't mention you. Okay? I'll see him at the police station, okay? See you Friday night, if not before.

SANDY:
Jeffrey, are they important things? Well forget me  you have to tell him. Jeffrey, I mean it.

JEFFREY:
Great. Hey, I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things that could help your father but you might get into trouble.

SANDY:
Yes. Is that so surprising? Yeah I worry, a lot. I got you into this.

JEFFREY:
You worry about me really?

JEFFREY:
Yeah, you're a mystery. I like you. Very much.

SANDY:
You like mysteries that much?

JEFFREY:
I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. And it's all secret.

SANDY:
Jeffrey? Why?

JEFFREY:
Yeah.

SANDY:
I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?

JEFFREY:
Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place.

SANDY:
Jeffrey!!

JEFFREY:
Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. Now get this. In the distance was a murder. A drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.

SANDY:
Oh yeah?

JEFFREY:
Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.

SANDY:
Nothing really, but it's interesting. They know each other. They seem to like each other.

JEFFREY:
Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now, the only trouble is, what does this prove?

SANDY:
Shoot.

JEFFREY:
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?

SANDY:
You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals.

SANDY:
Yeah, but I don't think it's going to do much good. Let's go. I'll try to talk to him later.

JEFFREY:
You want to go talk to him?

SANDY:
What am I going to do?

JEFFREY:
I'm really sorry.

SANDY:
You were late.

JEFFREY:
See ya tomorrow.

SANDY:
Goodnight.

JEFFREY:
Okay, okay.

SANDY:
You better not, Jeffrey.

JEFFREY:
Can I give you a kiss good night?

JEFFREY:
Okay, Sandy.

SANDY:
Okay, be careful.

JEFFREY:
I will. I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirtyfive, okay?

SANDY:
No, silly  I'm still in school you know. But I'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned. You better be careful, Jeffrey.

JEFFREY:
I guess so. You want to help me watch Frank? I'm going to stake out Frank's place tomorrow with a camera.

SANDY:
So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.

JEFFREY:
Yeah I guess so.  You're a neat girl.

SANDY:
I don't know. I had a dream. In fact, the night I met you.  In the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. You know, birds. Robins stood for love, and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. And it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. I guess, until the robins come there is trouble.

JEFFREY:
Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world?

SANDY:
You're sure right. It is a strange world.

JEFFREY:
That's what I thought.

SANDY:
Who, me? Why should it?

JEFFREY:
That doesn't bother you, does it?

SANDY:
Yeah?

JEFFREY:
Yeah. I mean a little, you know.

SANDY:
Did you see her undressed?

JEFFREY:
Yes.

SANDY:
Twice. Without her sensing anything?

JEFFREY:
Actually. I've been in twice.

SANDY:
You saw a lot in one night.

JEFFREY:
I don't see how I can, and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. Also it could get you in trouble.

SANDY:
Wow. Should you tell my father?

JEFFREY:
OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. This is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. They have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. The ears were for her a warning to stay alive. There is another man involved. I call him the yellow man. You saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man.

SANDY:
You want to tell me about it?

JEFFREY:
No way. I'm about to blow up.

SANDY:
You want a Dairy Queen?

SANDY:
It's okay. Don't worry about it.

JEFFREY:
I'm sorry, I didn't...

SANDY:
He got a little jealous.

JEFFREY:
What's with Mike?

JEFFREY:
Well.  Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else, you know what I mean?

SANDY:
What did you see?

JEFFREY:
Well, I've found out some things, nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved.

SANDY:
Well, how did it go? What happened?

SANDY:
Okay, okay. Bye.

JEFFREY:
That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you, okay?

SANDY:
I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.

JEFFREY:
Okay, thanks.

SANDY:
I'll honk four times so you'll hear it and know she's on her way up. Okay?

JEFFREY:
Are you sure?

SANDY:
I'm going to wait here until she comes.

JEFFREY:
Yeah.

SANDY:
Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?

JEFFREY:
Look, it can wait till Sunday.

SANDY:
Okay, yeah, call.

JEFFREY:
Oh, okay, can I call?

SANDY:
I, I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.

JEFFREY:
I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.

SANDY:
I wish you wouldn't do this. It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.

JEFFREY:
Could you wait a little while, this key may not fit.

SANDY:
OK.

JEFFREY:
Leave it in the front of your house for me, okay?

SANDY:
Yeah, but.

JEFFREY:
It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?

SANDY:
It's crazy and dangerous. My God, I shouldn't have told you.

JEFFREY:
Why not?

SANDY:
Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.

SANDY:
I'll drink to that.

JEFFREY:
Here's to. An interesting experience.

JEFFREY:
Two.

SANDY:
That sounds good.

SANDY:
This is not my usual Friday night!

JEFFREY:
Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.

SANDY:
Brilliant.

JEFFREY:
First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.

SANDY:
What's the plan.

JEFFREY:
Okay. You better get out before someone sees us.

SANDY:
Yeah, but don't pick me up. My father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.

JEFFREY:
Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?

SANDY:
I already know. The Slow Club. It's on Route 7.

JEFFREY:
First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.

SANDY:
I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me. Afterwards he can go out with the guys. Just so the record is kept straight though, I love Mike. What do want me to do?

JEFFREY:
I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.

SANDY:
You really want to do this, don't you?

JEFFREY:
Well, it's Friday night and you're a beautiful girl. I guess you would have a date, that does that.

SANDY:
Yes. I do.

JEFFREY:
You didn't goof it up, but you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday, do you have a date tonight?

SANDY:
I owe you, since I goofed up this one.

JEFFREY:
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?

SANDY:
So, what's next?

JEFFREY:
Yeah.

SANDY:
Yeah, if it opens the door.

JEFFREY:
I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?

SANDY:
No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.

JEFFREY:
Yes and no. Did you recognize him?

SANDY:
I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright?

JEFFREY:
Yeah, let's get outta here. What happened?

SANDY:
Are you alright?

SANDY:
Alright. Good luck, yourself.

JEFFREY:
Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay, goodluck. Three minutes, no sooner.

SANDY:
Oh brother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor. Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.

JEFFREY:
Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute, what's her name?

JEFFREY:
Let's go.

SANDY:
Alright.

JEFFREY:
Now, we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window, alright?

SANDY:
You've got a point there.

JEFFREY:
Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.

SANDY:
I don't know, it sounds like a good daydream, but actually doing it is too weird. Too dangerous.

JEFFREY:
You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few Awake magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. A few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?

SANDY:
What will I say when she comes to the door?

JEFFREY:
Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.

SANDY:
Now, how are you going to do that?

JEFFREY:
Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.

SANDY:
It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.

JEFFREY:
Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. Aren't you curious about my plan?

SANDY:
You said it was a strange world. And you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy? She is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.

JEFFREY:
There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. Sometimes, in some cases, it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment, you know, sneak in and hide and observe.

SANDY:
Alright, now tell me. What is it?

SANDY:
Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too smart.

JEFFREY:
I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.

SANDY:
I'm here, aren't I?

JEFFREY:
I don't want to cause any trouble.

SANDY:
Just a minute, pull over and wait a minute.

JEFFREY:
I'd like to talk to you about something.

SANDY:
I don't know.

JEFFREY:
You hungry or thirsty, or both?

JEFFREY:
Yeah. Good bye.

SANDY:
I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.

JEFFREY:
I guess I'll see you sometime.

JEFFREY:
Thanks for the tour. It was nice talking to you.

SANDY:
I've gotta go in.

JEFFREY:
I don't know. He moved away.

SANDY:
What happened to him?

JEFFREY:
It's not bad, but it's bad enough. It's a lot worse for my father.  I used to know a kid who lived there and who had the biggest tongue in the world.

SANDY:
Still, it must be kinda rough.

JEFFREY:
I have to help out in my father's hardware store. They're giving me sort of my own hours for a while, which is nice.

SANDY:
Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?

JEFFREY:
You really do hear a lot, don't you?

SANDY:
My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. Left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.

JEFFREY:
Oh yeah. What about those other people? Anything?

SANDY:
I don't know, like I said, she's not my father's case.

JEFFREY:
Did they find out anything when they questioned her?

SANDY:
I don't know, you're not supposed to see them. They're supposed to see you.

JEFFREY:
Where are they?

SANDY:
That's the building. She lives on the Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long, the police are watching.

SANDY:
Not really, why?  You want to see the building? Come on, I'll show you.

JEFFREY:
I guess you have to get back home soon?

SANDY:
Yeah. It's close by, that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.

JEFFREY:
It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?

SANDY:
Maybe so.

JEFFREY:
The ear is from a missing person maybe?

SANDY:
No, this has been going on for some time. Several months. About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. They were from people who were reported missing. They never found one complete body, only parts.

JEFFREY:
Were all these people questioned this afternoon?

SANDY:
There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. And a musician. And some others.

JEFFREY:
Do you know who was brought in for questioning?

SANDY:
I don't really know much but bits and pieces. I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear, there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.

JEFFREY:
Come on, you brought it up. Do you know anything?

SANDY:
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it?

JEFFREY:
What do you know about the ear? Anything?

SANDY:
That's too bad.

JEFFREY:
I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.

SANDY:
Yeah. What are you doing now?

JEFFREY:
What else is new? Right?

SANDY:
Terrible boring.

JEFFREY:
How is Central these days?

SANDY:
Yes.

JEFFREY:
No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?

SANDY:
Am I bothering you?

JEFFREY:
Yeah I did, treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.

SANDY:
You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?

JEFFREY:
Oh yeah?

SANDY:
I just know, that's all. I remember you from Central.

JEFFREY:
Yeah, how did you know?

MIKE:
You shut up. Nobody's talkin' to you. Hey who's that Jeffrey? Your mother?

SANDY:
Stop it Mike.

MIKE:
Hey come here, you stole my girl, you bastard. I'm gonna kick your ass, right in front of your stupid house.

SANDY:
Okay.

MIKE:
Come on out a minute, okay?

SANDY:
Sure, just a sec.  Excuse me.

MIKE:
Sandy? Could I talk to you a minute?

SANDY:
Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come on.

MIKE:
I don't know why we have to watch TV.

SANDY:
You can change it if you want to.

MIKE:
What are watchin' this junk for?

MIKE:
Yeah, nice meetin' you.

SANDY:
Mike's gotta go.  Nice to meet you.

BATTY:
That wouldn't be very sporting.

MARY:
Then go get him.

BATTY:
One man.  He must be good.

BATTY:
You underestimate the trap, Mary.

MARY:
Not to be trapped.

BATTY:
What's the point?

MARY:
Anywhere.

BATTY:
Where?

MARY:
Let's go while there is still time.

BATTY:
Pris?

MARY:
I don't think there is another human being in this whole world who would have helped us.

BATTY:
I'm sure glad you found us, Sebastian.  What do you think, Mary?

BATTY:
Mr. Sebastian is a host who wants to be appreciated.  We'll appreciate him and he'll cooperate.

MARY:
If he won't cooperate?

BATTY:
He knows what he's doing.

BATTY:
Well stocked.

MARY:
You certainly have a nice place here.

BATTY:
We're not used to the big city. Where we come from it's not so easy to get lost.

MARY:
We were worried to death.  It's awfully kind of you.

BATTY:
Can't thank you enough, Mr. Sebastian. If you hadn't come along...

BATTY:
Nothing the God of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.

TYRELL:
Also extraordinary things.

BATTY:
I've done some questionable things.

BATTY:
I am?

TYRELL:
Also you're too valuable to experiment with.

TYRELL:
Put it this way.  Rolls Royces are made to last  as least they were. But I'm afraid you're a Ferrari. A high strung racing car  built to win, not to last.

BATTY:
But not to last.

TYRELL:
Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an error in replication, so that the newly formed DNA strand carries a mutation and you're got a virus again... but all this is academic  you are made as good as we could make you.
