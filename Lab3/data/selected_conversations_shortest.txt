BERNICE:
That's a very nice compliment, and I'd like to say that...you've done the same for me.

MILTON:
Just in case I don't have a chance to say goodbye, I want you to know that I haven't spent so many pleasant hours for many years.

BERNICE:
No. I'm all alone.

MILTON:
I'm sure we'll both make it...but just in case one of us...well, is there a message you'd like me to give someone?

MILTON:
That's a lovely name. Mine's Milton...Milt Ettenhenim. But my friends call me 'Bubbles.'

BERNICE:
Mine's Eleanor. Eleanor Schiff.

MILTON:
You know, here we are having coffee together, and discussing education and business and economy...and we don't even know each other's names...full names I mean.

BERNICE:
I wish I could fool myself into believing that that's the reason. The truth of the matter is, nobody ever asked me.

MILTON:
I know the answer  Career. A smart woman like you became so involved in your work, you didn't have time for marriage.

BERNICE:
Well, I'm afraid that's a question that's all too easy to answer.

MILTON:
But I think it's time we stopped talking about me. A woman like you  why haven't you ever married?

BERNICE:
Well, after a thing like that you wouldn't be expected to.

MILTON:
After my wife died, I felt like a fifth wheel. You know, so many years being with one person  a very wonderful person  makes you always think of yourself as part of a pair...When Ethel passed away, I was lost. I couldn't function socially and I couldn't function in business.

MILTON:
No. I'm from Washington, D.C. I'm a lobbyist for the Small Businessmen's Assocation.

BERNICE:
Well, it really wasn't a vacation. You see, I'm a teacher in the New York City school system, and I was attending a seminar on visual aids to education. Are you from L.A.?

MILTON:
Were you vacationing in Los Angeles?

BERNICE:
No, thank you. I take it black. Like my men.

MILTON:
Thank you. Cream?

BERNICE:
Ah, won't you sit down?

BERNICE:
That's very nice of you. Thank you.

MILTON:
I happened to be passing, and I thought you might like some corfee.

MRS. KRAMER:
Shep, no! He gets so excited when new people are here.

CAREY:
...but after...awhile...you begin to...  ...get used to it.

MRS. KRAMER:
Shep, no! I'll bet you have exciting things happen all the time down there.

CAREY:
Yeah, something like that, but as I say, they didn't have time to tell me very much.

MRS. KRAMER:
Something about a plane with no pilot?

CAREY:
Well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.

MRS. KRAMER:
Shep, sit...sit! So, I understand you've got a real emergency down there.

MRS. KRAMER:
Oh, yes. Come in, Paul. Rex will be right out.

CAREY:
Hello, I'm Paul Carey from the airline. I'm here to pick up Captain Kramer.

STRIKER:
Excuse me, Doc, I've got a plane to land.

DR. RUMACK:
And the last thing he said to me, Doc, he said, Sometime when the crew is up against it and the breaks are beating the boys, tell them to go out there with all they've got and win just one for the Zipper. I don't know where I'll be then, Doc, he said, but I won't smell too good. That's for sure.

STRIKER:
George Zipp said that?

DR. RUMACK:
